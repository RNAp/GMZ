The API is described below:

'''
The following method takes in a seed news and a news article and tries to calculate Jaccard similarity for content info S & T/ (S or T)
The news articles are in dict format
'''

    num_overlap = len(overlapSet)

    score = num_overlap/num_comb

        if seedID in article.get('id', None):
            seed = article
            break
    return seed

'''
The following method takes in seedID and a list of articles--ArticleReader, and finds seed news, and calculate similarity scores for each article
'''
