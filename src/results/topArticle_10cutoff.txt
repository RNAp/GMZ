C	aspen (colorado): physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said today that they had discovered a new particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a long sought particle that is a key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern in an interview from his office outside of geneva. his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end of the longest most expensive manhunt in the history of science and, if scientists are lucky, could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. ( read: cern on the experiment ) dr heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, the heaviest subatomic particle yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data, wednesday called the discovery, " very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday saturday, bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. that was a scene that was duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, to los angeles to chicago to princeton, new york city, london, and beyond, everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. women take top two slots in civil services ex ... honest criticism should help mamata learn fro ... atmosphere of intolerance towards criticism i ... what is god particle? the theoretical higgs particle has been likened to a celebrity, say george clooney, walking down a street with a gaggle of photographers (the higgs field) clustered around him. uncovered: so what's on the cover of j.k. rowling's first adult novel?

C	the british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern's headquarters on wednesday. (pool photo by denis balibouse) physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant.it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond -- everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson -- and there are hints of some already -- could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter?

"it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email, "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." the cern press release is, of course, cautious in describing what it is the scientists believe they have discovered: geneva, 4 july 2012. at a seminar held at cern 1 today as a curtain raiser to the year's major particle physics conference, ichep2012 in melbourne, the atlas and cms experiments presented their latest preliminary results in the search for the long sought higgs particle. both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev. "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage," said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, "but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication." "the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found," said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. "the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director sergio bertolucci. " we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data." five sigma certainty is the gold standard in particle physics and essentially means that the scientists are as certain that they can be that the measurements they recorded are not the result of an anomaly or random chance. as the bbc reports, professor peter higgs himself, who was part of the team of scientists whose work led tot the creation of the theories surrounding the higgs boson and, of course the still-theoretical particle that bears his name, was present for the announcement at cern: prof peter higgs, after whom the particle is named, wiped a tear from his eye as the teams finished their presentations in the cern auditorium. "i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement," he added later. "it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime." it's not often that you get particle physicists emotional, or popping champagne corks early in the morning as one group gathered in aspen, colorado did this morning, so that's a pretty good indication of just how big a deal this discovery is, and tom chivers tries to explain what it all means in layman's terms: first, as was hinted yesterday, the cms detector - one of the two major experiments at the large hadron collider - has definitely found something . prof james incandela, the spokesman for the experiment, said they have seen something "very strong, very solid" at the 125gev (gigaelectronvolt) mass, where they had thought they'd seen something in december. the first slide showed a curve of results, with a single bump up at 125gev. "it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks : "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. actually, it would probably be much more interesting if it turned out that this new particle

T	relevant science: cern physicists may have discovered higgs boson particle

"higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory, including peter higgs of the university of edinburgh, had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr. incandela's making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn.dr. incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant sandstorm into a man on horseback in the movie "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal has grown over the last year, until it practically jumps off the chart, according to those who have seen it. "i believe it now, i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy -einstein showed they are the same - that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood their signal was due to a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela and dr. gianotti's presentations were constantly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. fabiola gianotti, of cern and spokeswoman for the atlas team, said one on point, "why are you applauding, i'm not done yet. this is just beginning, there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviors and channels, "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons; and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr. higgs of the university of edinburgh, was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london, carl hagen of university of rochester, dr. guralnik of brown university, and francois englert and the late robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr. heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of the year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing some its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgs-like fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an anti-gravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe, and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said dr. tonelli. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, but the extra bounty of higgs bosons suggests that the standard model is cracking, a prospect that the physicists find thrilling. in an email, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team at cern wrote about the higgs, "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nyt

T	our place in the world: 839. a new particle could be physics' holy grail
C	by denise overbye, the new york times , july 4, 2012 british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern headquarters today aspen, colo. - physicists working at cern 's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. the british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern's headquarters on wednesday.

"so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons; and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr. higgs of the university of edinburgh, was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london, carl hagen of university of rochester, dr. guralnik of brown university, and francois englert and the late robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr. heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of the year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing some its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgs-like fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an anti-gravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe, and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said dr. tonelli. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillions of proton collisions, will tell. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team at cern wrote about the higgs, "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time."

T	a new particle could be physics' holy grail | ndtv.com
C	aspen (colorado): physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signalled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "i was really impressed. it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins!" at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads - will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart.

"i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond -- everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "i was really impressed. it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins!" at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson -- and there are hints of some already -- could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story -- more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads -- will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each -- one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela -- operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr. incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr. incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart. "i believe it now; i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy -- einstein showed they are the same -- that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti said at one point: "why are you applauding? i'm not done yet. this is just beginning. there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviors and channels. "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons, and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and francois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute, they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr. heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of this year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgslike fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far, the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," dr. tonelli said. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillion proton collisions, will tell.

C	a section of cern's large hadron collider. leading physicists are saying it's still too soon to know whether cern's newly discovered subatomic particle fits the description given by the standard model ~ the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century ~ or whether it is an impostor, a single particle, or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. according to today's new york times, cern director rolf-dieter heuer's exclamation earlier today of, "i think we have it," signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the times contends, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle.

C	a view of the lhc (large hadron collider) in its tunnel at cern. (ap photo) aspen (colorado): physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signalled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "i was really impressed. it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins!" at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads - will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart. "i believe it now; i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy - einstein showed they are the same - that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr incandela's and dr gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr gianotti said at one point: "why are you applauding? i'm not done yet. this is just beginning. there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviours and channels. "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons; and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr higgs of the university of edinburgh was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london, carl hagen of university of rochester, dr guralnik of brown university, and francois englert and the late robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odourless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of large hadron collider. both dr heuer and dr gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of the year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing some its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgs-like fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an anti-gravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe, and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said dr tonelli. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillions of proton collisions, will tell. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team at cern wrote about the higgs, "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time."

T	cern physicists may have discovered higgs boson particle - nytimes.com
C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times proton collisions from the search. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail.

T	physicists at cern?s large hadron collider discover new subatomic particle that looks like the higgs boson
C	higgs boson video: a metaphor to explain the particle, or further confuse you u.s. adds forces in persian gulf, a signal to iran (new york times, july 3, 2012) aspen, colo. - physicists working at large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe.

"what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads - will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr. incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr. incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart. "i believe it now; i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy - einstein showed they are the same - that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti said at one point: "why are you applauding? i'm not done yet. this is just beginning. there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviors and channels. "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons, and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and francois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute, they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr. heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of this year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgslike fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far, the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," dr. tonelli said. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillion proton collisions, will tell.

T	higgs boson 'discovery' signals one of the longest, most expensive searches in science history - the economic times
C	tweet physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer , the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. dr heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have to find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research . joe incandela, of the university of california , santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here, at the aspen center for physics , a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs , the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. abc of large hadron collider what is a boson? the universe is made up of two classes of particles: bosons and fermions. bosons obey bose-einstein statistics - a collection of them can condense together into a state where the particles are indistinguishable. this theory was developed by sn bose and expanded by einstein. the special state of matter, called bose-einstein condensate, was created in 1995. all bosons can condense into this state at very low temperatures. post a comment email this article mail this article print this article save this article my saved articles reduce font size increase font size page1 of 2 prev next

"it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

T	physicists may have discovered long-sought higgs boson
C	austin seeks to rewrite onerous development rules, amid neighborhood concerns - physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," rolf-?dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. heuer and others said it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the past half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists because they could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say, all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. but detecting a higgs boson is not easy. its lifetime is so short that it cannot be observed directly. instead, researchers can only see its breakdown products, and that is where the uncertainty comes in. some of the particle interactions that would be produced by a higgs disintegration could potentially be produced from other sources as well, which is why the teams had to look at so many collisions. physicists said they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." the announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which smashes protons into each other. the collider has been running for just two years, and only at about half its maximum theoretical power. it was scheduled to be shut down in october for two years of maintenance, but heuer said it will now run until the end of the year so that teams can gather more data on the new particle. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. 5th annual bug festival at zilker park

"what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data presented in graphs with bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti noted that the mass of the putative higgs, apparently one of the heaviest subatomic particles, made it easy to study its many behaviors. "thanks, nature," she said. gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause, like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime," he said. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented what came to be known as the higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and fran?ois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough with the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen possible ways, depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not describe how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find, eluding researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare in abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the "goddamn particle.") finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly. so far, the physicists admit, they know little about their new boson. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the boson while others might be underproducing it, clues that maybe there is more at work here than the standard model would predict. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said guido tonelli of cern. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team of physicists, said: "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins."

T	voice from the desert ? blog archive ? physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe
C	vatican is graded on financial transparency (but the report remains secret for now) * * * physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe 95 comments aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the proton collisions from the search. readers' comments like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data presented in graphs with bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti noted that the mass of the putative higgs, apparently one of the heaviest subatomic particles, made it easy to study its many behaviors. "thanks, nature," she said. gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause, like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime," he said. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented what came to be known as the higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and fran?ois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough with the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen possible ways, depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not describe how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find, eluding researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare in abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the "goddamn particle.") finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly. so far, the physicists admit, they know little about their new boson. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the boson while others might be underproducing it, clues that maybe there is more at work here than the standard model would predict. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said guido tonelli of cern. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team of physicists, said: "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins." this entry was posted on thursday, july 5, 2012 at 8:28 pm and is filed under vatican is graded on financial transparency (but the report remains secret for now) oregon insurer requires church to take unusual abuse prevention steps from bishop john shelby spong: "think different-accept uncertainty" part xiii: miracles as signs to be interpreted on the roman catholic church and its teachings on sex and women: how does ancient greek medicine impact the church today? from bishop john shelby spong: "think different-accept uncertainty" part xiii: miracles as signs to be interpreted

T	our place in the world: 843. physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe
C	by dennis, overbye, the new york times , july 4, 2012 scientists in geneva on wednesday applauded the discovery of a subatomic particle that looks like the higgs boson. aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart.
