T	scientists find particles responsible for mass of objects in universe - buenosairesherald.com
C	wednesday, july 4, 2012 scientists find particles responsible for mass of objects in universe a graphic showing traces of collision of particles at the compact muon solenoid (cms) experience is pictured with a slow speed experience at universe of particles exhibition of the the european organization for nuclear research (cern). scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, often called the "god particle" because it may bring mass and order to the universe. "we have indeed discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson," john womersley, head of a british public research body, told journalists and scientists in london today. "these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe." joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." cern's director general rolph heuer said: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it." addressing the scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer asked: "would you agree?" they burst into applause. peter higgs, the 83-year-old british physicist who proposed the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s, was at cern to welcome the news. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes brimming, he told the symposium: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself.without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model. it could also be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva and london to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn. "we still much we don't know about particles - this is only the beginning of a new journey. we have closed one chapter and opened another," peter knight of britain's institute of physics told reporters. oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters: "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. "but we can't yet say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." higgs called it a great achievement for the large hadron collider, the 27-km (17-mile) long particle accelerator built in a tunnel underneath the french-swiss border where experiments to search for the higgs boson have taken place. scientists find particles responsible for mass of objects in universe scientists to unveil particles responsible for mass of objects in universe

T	cern announces discovery of new particle in leaked video | the raw story
C	joan walsh on gop anger at roberts: they believed they controlled the court the cern physics laboratory near geneva appeared to leak crucial details of its hunt for the long-sought higgs boson particle on tuesday when it senior scientists at cern are due to reveal the latest findings in the hunt for the famed particle at a much-anticipated press conference in geneva on wednesday, and had tried to keep the results under wraps, despite intense rumours that the laboratory had found the particle. but cern, which takes credit for inventing the world wide web, inadvertently released a video interview on its website dated 4 july 2012 in which spokesman joe incandela states the lab has "observed a new particle". a press officer at the laboratory blamed a technical glitch for the video going live. the interview was taken down shortly after. speaking on the video, incandela stopped short of claiming the particle was the higgs boson, saying more work was needed to be sure. "we have quite strong evidence that there's something there. it's properties are still going to take us a little bit of time," he said. the details incandela revealed suggest it has the hallmarks of the higgs particle. "we can see that it decays into two photons, for example, which tells us it's a boson, it's a particle with integer spin, and we know its mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the proton. and this is very significant. "this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all this, which i think we will," he said. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks," he added. a spokesperson for cern said the video went live on the internet due to a "technical fault". they added that the lab had recorded several videos in advance with spokespersons at the lab. two teams of physicists at cern are preparing to announce their latest efforts to discover the higgs boson at a press conference at the laboratory on wednesday morning. details will be unveiled by fabiola gianotti and incandela, the respective leaders of teams that use the giant atlas and cms detectors to search for new particles. the higgs boson, named after the edinburgh university physicist peter higgs, who proposed it in 1964, has become the most sought-after particle in modern science and its discovery is a major focus of research at the lhc. discovery of the particle would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space. without it, or something to do its job, there would be no stars, planets or life as we know it. according to theory, the higgs field switched on a trillionth of a second after the big bang that flung the universe into existence. before this moment, all of the particles in the universe were massless and zipped around at the speed of light. when the higgs field switched on, it changed the future of the universe. particles such as the quarks and electrons that make up normal matter felt a "drag" from the field, which manifests itself as mass. the more a particle feels the field, the heavier it becomes. some particles, like photons, pass through the field untouched, and so remain massless and move at the speed of light. some theories known as "supersymmetry" predict the existence of several kinds of higgs particles, along with a host of other particles that have yet to be discovered. whatever cern announces, there is plenty more work ahead for the scientists. "if something significant and new is found on wednesday that would be fantastic, but we're not going to know firstly that it's a higgs boson, or secondly what kind of higgs particle it might be, until we've made a much more thorough investigation of how it behaves," said shears. about raw story raw story is a progressive news site that focuses on stories often ignored in the mainstream media. while giving coverage to the big stories of the day, we also bring our readers' attention to policy, politics, legal and human rights stories that get ignored in an infotainment culture driven solely by pageviews. founded in cambridge, ma in 2004, raw story reaches more than 2.7 million unique readers per month and serves more than 11.4 million pageviews. recent focal points have included occupy wall street, wikileaks, wiretapping and judicial abuse.

T	the himalayan times - scientists to unveil milestone in higgs boson hunt - detail news
C	last updated at: 2012-07-04 7:36 am the himalayan times - saved articles(s) a technician looks at collision at the cms experiment in the control room of the large hadron collider (lhc) at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) near geneva april 5, 2012. london: scientists hunting the elusive subatomic 'higgs' particle will unveil findings on wednesday that take them nearer to understanding how the big bang at the dawn of time gave rise to stars, planets and even life. physicists who have been smashing particles together near light-speed at the cern laboratory near geneva have already seen tantalising glimpses of the "higgs boson", the missing piece of the fundamental theory of physics known as the standard model. the world of science now awaits a mass of evidence big enough to be deemed a formal discovery. the secrecy surrounding wednesday's announcement has fuelled speculation that nearly 40 years of research have reached a climax. data harvested from cern's large hadron collider, the biggest particle accelerator in the world, could also shed light on the make-up of the poorly understood 'dark matter' and "dark energy" that make up 96 percent of the universe. it may even point the way to research into the possibility of parallel universes. cern is planning to beam the announcement live around the world to a physics conference in melbourne, australia. related events are planned in countries involved in the project, including britain. the unusual level of stage management has fuelled the sense that big news is on the cards. on monday, u.s. physicists said they had found the strongest evidence yet of the existence of the higgs in a mass of data collected from the now-mothballed tevatron particle accelerator, run by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago. "it will be interesting to see how it lines up with cern's results on wednesday," said cern spokesman james gillies. some scientists working on the project have told reuters they expect the unveiling of a formal discovery while others expect it to fall just short. with thousands of physicists involved, divided into two separate teams called atlas and cms, cern insists the full picture will not be clear to anyone until a seminar shortly before wednesday's announcement. "even cern's director general won't know much before the seminar reveals the exact results," said pauline gagnon, a canadian particle physicist working on atlas. "they are being finalised at the last minute after much scrutiny." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. scientists say the existence of dark matter and dark energy suggests the standard model, if validated by a higgs discovery, is just the first layer of a more complex theory that includes the vast bulk of the universe that is now poorly understood. "the standard model has a few major flaws; the higgs boson discovery would only fix one of them," said gagnon.

"'observation' generally means a lower standard of evidence.... however, it appears that (cern is) sensibly playing this down, with nothing in the video mentioning the word 'discovery' or their decision not to use that word," he said. the video hints that cern's word choice is indeed intentional. cern spokesman incandela describes their findings as "one of the biggest discoveries..." before correcting himself to add "... or observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years." the origin of mass (meaning the resistance of an object to being moved) has been fiercely debated for decades. finding the higgs boson would vindicate the so-called standard model of physics, a theory that developed in the early 1970s, which says the universe is made from 12 particles which provide the building blocks for all matter. the quest to prove, or disprove, the higgs has been carried out at particle colliders: giant machines that smash protons together and sift through the sub-atomic debris that tumbles out. the big daddy of these is the large hadron collider (lhc), operated by cern in a ring-shaped tunnel deep underground near geneva. smashups generated at the lhc briefly generate temperatures 100,000 times hotter than the sun, replicating the conditions that occurred just after the universe's creation in the "big bang" nearly 14 billion years ago. but these concentrations of energy, while violent, occur only at a tiny scale. evidence to support the existence of the higgs is indirect.

T	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind | bangkok post: news
C	bern - after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. this graphic shows traces of colliding particles measured with the compact muon solenoid experiment at the european organization for nuclear research (cern). physicists say they have found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson, which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. the higgs boson has been dubbed the "god particle". "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. did you know? you can introduce your kids to edutainment reading with our student weekly magazine : thailand's only all-english entertainment and education magazine for teens and all ages. sign in once and access every part of the website at your convenience! log in to our bangkokpost.com community to post your comment. clicking here. if you are not part of the community yet, please rss post publishing online media network:

T	cern announces discovery of new particle in leaked video | the raw story
C	rep. walsh flips out, digs in on criticism of double-amputee veteran the cern physics laboratory near geneva appeared to leak crucial details of its hunt for the long-sought higgs boson particle on tuesday when it senior scientists at cern are due to reveal the latest findings in the hunt for the famed particle at a much-anticipated press conference in geneva on wednesday, and had tried to keep the results under wraps, despite intense rumours that the laboratory had found the particle. but cern, which takes credit for inventing the world wide web, inadvertently released a video interview on its website dated 4 july 2012 in which spokesman joe incandela states the lab has "observed a new particle". a press officer at the laboratory blamed a technical glitch for the video going live. the interview was taken down shortly after. speaking on the video, incandela stopped short of claiming the particle was the higgs boson, saying more work was needed to be sure. "we have quite strong evidence that there's something there. it's properties are still going to take us a little bit of time," he said. the details incandela revealed suggest it has the hallmarks of the higgs particle. "we can see that it decays into two photons, for example, which tells us it's a boson, it's a particle with integer spin, and we know its mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the proton. and this is very significant. "this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all this, which i think we will," he said. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks," he added. a spokesperson for cern said the video went live on the internet due to a "technical fault". they added that the lab had recorded several videos in advance with spokespersons at the lab. two teams of physicists at cern are preparing to announce their latest efforts to discover the higgs boson at a press conference at the laboratory on wednesday morning. details will be unveiled by fabiola gianotti and incandela, the respective leaders of teams that use the giant atlas and cms detectors to search for new particles. the higgs boson, named after the edinburgh university physicist peter higgs, who proposed it in 1964, has become the most sought-after particle in modern science and its discovery is a major focus of research at the lhc. discovery of the particle would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space. without it, or something to do its job, there would be no stars, planets or life as we know it. according to theory, the higgs field switched on a trillionth of a second after the big bang that flung the universe into existence. before this moment, all of the particles in the universe were massless and zipped around at the speed of light. when the higgs field switched on, it changed the future of the universe. particles such as the quarks and electrons that make up normal matter felt a "drag" from the field, which manifests itself as mass. the more a particle feels the field, the heavier it becomes. some particles, like photons, pass through the field untouched, and so remain massless and move at the speed of light. some theories known as "supersymmetry" predict the existence of several kinds of higgs particles, along with a host of other particles that have yet to be discovered. whatever cern announces, there is plenty more work ahead for the scientists. "if something significant and new is found on wednesday that would be fantastic, but we're not going to know firstly that it's a higgs boson, or secondly what kind of higgs particle it might be, until we've made a much more thorough investigation of how it behaves," said shears. about raw story raw story is a progressive news site that focuses on stories often ignored in the mainstream media. while giving coverage to the big stories of the day, we also bring our readers' attention to policy, politics, legal and human rights stories that get ignored in an infotainment culture driven solely by pageviews. founded in cambridge, ma in 2004, raw story reaches more than 2.7 million unique readers per month and serves more than 11.4 million pageviews. recent focal points have included occupy wall street, wikileaks, wiretapping and judicial abuse.

C	london: scientists hunting the elusive subatomic 'higgs' particle will unveil findings on wednesday that take them nearer to understanding how the big bang at the dawn of time gave rise to stars, planets and even life. physicists who have been smashing particles together near light-speed at the cern laboratory near geneva have already seen tantalising glimpses of the "higgs boson", the missing piece of the fundamental theory of physics known as the standard model. the world of science now awaits a mass of evidence big enough to be deemed a formal discovery. the secrecy surrounding wednesday's announcement has fuelled speculation that nearly 40 years of research have reached a climax. data harvested from cern's large hadron collider, the biggest particle accelerator in the world, could also shed light on the make-up of the poorly understood 'dark matter' and "dark energy" that make up 96 percent of the universe. it may even point the way to research into the possibility of parallel universes. cern is planning to beam the announcement live around the world to a physics conference in melbourne, australia. related events are planned in countries involved in the project, including britain. the unusual level of stage management has fuelled the sense that big news is on the cards. on monday, us physicists said they had found the strongest evidence yet of the existence of the higgs in a mass of data collected from the now-mothballed tevatron particle accelerator, run by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago. "it will be interesting to see how it lines up with cern's results on wednesday," said cern spokesman james gillies. some scientists working on the project have told reuters they expect the unveiling of a formal discovery while others expect it to fall just short. with thousands of physicists involved, divided into two separate teams called atlas and cms, cern insists the full picture will not be clear to anyone until a seminar shortly before wednesday's announcement. "even cern's director general won't know much before the seminar reveals the exact results," said pauline gagnon, a canadian particle physicist working on atlas. "they are being finalised at the last minute after much scrutiny." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. scientists say the existence of dark matter and dark energy suggests the standard model, if validated by a higgs discovery, is just the first layer of a more complex theory that includes the vast bulk of the universe that is now poorly understood. "the standard model has a few major flaws; the higgs boson discovery would only fix one of them," said gagnon. "we still have no clue regarding what makes 96 percent of the content of the universe. this should keep us physicists busy for a few more decades." reference : -

T	is the hunt for the higgs almost over?- timesnow.tv - latest breaking news, big news stories, news videos
C	european physicists will make an announcement today that may solve a decades-old puzzle about the nature of matter, leave the question only part-answered or serve up yet another mystery. in a profession driven by rationality, particle scientists gave full rein to their emotions as they pondered what could lie in store in geneva. it is there that the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) will unveil the latest data in its search for the higgs boson, an elusive sub-atomic particle that is believed to confer mass. the higgs has led scientists a merry dance since 1964, when british physicist peter higgs helped lay the conceptual foundation for it. if the beast exists, it would vindicate the so-called standard model of physics, which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. on the eve of the announcement, rumours flew about what cern had in store. on twitter, a conversational thread was called "higgsteria," and managed to fuel speculation and quash it at the same time. "whether or not the higgs has been found, tomorrow will be exciting," professor sir peter knight, president of britain's institute of physics, told afp. "if the standard model is confirmed via the discovery of the higgs boson or whether we need to abandon and start re-writing the textbooks, it's a historical day in science that we should all be proud of." a big question concerns the degree of probability to make a claim. cern physicists have said they will not make an announcement until they have proof -- from two laboratories working independently at the mighty large hadr on collider (lhc) -- that the risk of a statistical fluke is vanishingly small. in scientific parlance, the goal is "five sigma," meaning that there is just a 0.00006 per cent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. in a news report, the british science journal nature said cern will announce that the two labs saw signals of a new particle with a probability of between 4.5 and five sigma. but cern will stop short of calling it the higgs until more is known about what the particle does, nature said. "crucially, they will want to know whether it behaves like a mass-giving higgs, and more specifically whether it behaves like the higgs predicted in the standard model," the journal said.

T	positive: eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle
C	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle 4 july 2012 geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of 'the missing cornerstone of physics' wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or 'god particle,' which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of physics. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists shed tears reflecting on the decades of work that brought them to this momentous occasion. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself-an extremely fine distinction. 'as a layman, i think we did it,' he told the elated crowd. 'we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson.' the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, sends protons whizzing in a circle at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced 'events' with significant data, said joe incandela, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had 'observed' a new subatomic particle-a boson. heuer said the discovery was 'most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is.' as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. 'thanks, nature!' joked fabiola gianotti, head of the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because 'the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that.' incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. 'it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime,' he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be found, but he was 'still somewhat stunned by the results.' the phrase 'god particle' was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the theory got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. 'this boson is a very profound thing we have found,' he said. 'we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration.' the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development the way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. 'this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied,' he added. 'we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries.' copyright ? 2012 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. every day global good news documents the rise of a better quality of life dawning in the world from good news reported by the press; and highlights the need for introducing natural law based-total knowledge based-programmes to bring the support of nature to every individual, raise the quality of life of every society, and create a lasting state of world peace.

T	positive: 'it's a boson:' higgs quest bears new particle
C	'it's a boson:' higgs quest bears new particle geneva (reuters) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. 'we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature,' cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. 'the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe.' two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: 'as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?' a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: 'it's the higgs,' said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. 'the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. 'nobel prizes all round.' higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the 'god particle', for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: 'it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime.' scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained 'dark matter' they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. end of an era 'it is very satisfying,' higgs told reuters. 'for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago,' he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. 'i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened,' he said of the speed with which they found evidence. 'for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model,' he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the 'celebrity' of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. 'that is what we are sure is the higgs,' a cern scientist said. less than one in a million 'it's a boson!' headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the 'dramatic 5 sigma signal' for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. 'the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful,' oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. 'we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted.' 'if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs.' al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: 'cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson,' he said. 'in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs.' universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: 'we have closed one chapter and opened another,' said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: 'this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made.' higgs himself called it a great achievement for cern's collider. without it, his ideas would remain just a paper theory and he conceded that he personally was never cut out for laboratory experimentation: 'i certainly did some lab work as a schoolboy in bristol,' he told reuters. 'i was incompetent.'

T	scientists to unveil higgs boson findings - rt? news

T	scientists to unveil milestone in higgs boson hunt | reuters
C	paradise regained: clayton christensen and the path to salvation geneva (reuters) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the "celebrity" of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. "that is what we are sure is the higgs," a cern scientist said. "it's a boson!" headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the "dramatic 5 sigma signal" for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. "the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful," oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. "we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted." "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: "cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson," he said. "in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs." the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: "we have closed one chapter and opened another," said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: "this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made." higgs himself called it a great achievement for cern's collider. without it, his ideas would remain just a paper theory and he conceded that he personally was never cut out for laboratory experimentation: "i certainly did some lab work as a schoolboy in bristol," he told reuters. "i was incompetent." we welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data. if you see a comment that you believe is irrelevant or inappropriate, you can flag it to our editors by using the report abuse links. views expressed in the comments do not represent those of reuters. for more information on our comment policy, see but, we won't be able to answer-as of yet- what gave rise to the big bang itself!

C	tension builds over 'god particle' update scientists hunting the elusive subatomic "higgs" particle will unveil findings that take them nearer to understanding how the big bang at the dawn of time gave rise to stars, planets and even life. physicists who have been smashing particles together at near light-speed at the cern laboratory near geneva have already seen tantalising glimpses of the "higgs boson", the missing piece of the fundamental theory of physics known as the standard model. the world of science now awaits a mass of evidence big enough to be deemed a formal discovery. the secrecy surrounding wednesday's announcement has fuelled speculation that nearly 40 years of research have reached a climax. cern accidentally released a video on its website briefly overnight announcing a "new particle" had been observed, but its representatives declined to comment on whether that was what would be announced later in the day.

"they are being finalised at the last minute after much scrutiny." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. scientists say the existence of dark matter and dark energy suggests the standard model, if validated by a higgs discovery, is just the first layer of a more complex theory that includes the vast bulk of the universe that is now poorly understood. "the standard model has a few major flaws; the higgs boson discovery would only fix one of them," said gagnon.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle'
C	rolf heuer, director general of cern (european organization for nuclear research), answers journalist's question about the scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin near geneva, switzerland, wednesday, july 4, 2012. the head of the world's biggest atom smasher is claiming discovery of a new particle that he says is consistent with the long-sought higgs boson known popularly as the "god particle." rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, says "we have a discovery" of a new subatomic particle, a boson, that is "consistent with a higgs boson." he spoke after two independent teams at cern said they have both "observed" a new boson that looks just like the one believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. (ap photo/keystone/martial trezzini) "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration." the times leader 15 n. main street, wilkes-barre, pa 18711 | 570-829-7100 or 800-427-8649 | copyright 12 impressions media. all rights reserved.

T	higgs boson | tantalisingly close to discovery | stuff.co.nz
C	so close to finding the 'god particle' physicists at a us laboratory say they have come tantalisingly close to proving the existence of the elusive subatomic higgs boson - often called the "god particle" because it may bring mass and order to the universe. the announcement by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago came two days before physicists at cern, the european particle accelerator near geneva, are set to unveil their own findings in the higgs hunt. cern houses the world's most powerful particle accelerator, the large hadron collider (lhc). the fermilab scientists found hints of the higgs in the debris from trillions of collisions between beams of protons and anti-protons over 10 years at the lab's now-shuttered tevatron accelerator. but the evidence still fell short of the scientific threshold for proof of the discovery of the particle, they said, in that the same collision debris hinting at the existence of the higgs could also come from other subatomic particles. "this is the best answer that is out there at the moment," said physicist rob roser of fermilab, which is run by the us department of energy. "the tevatron data strongly point toward the existence of the higgs boson, but it will take results from the experiments at the large hadron collider in europe to establish a firm discovery." scientists have worked long and hard to prove the existence of the higgs boson, the final piece of a model proposed four decades ago laying out the basic building blocks of matter in the universe. the higgs particle's presumed power to confer mass seems to endow it with the power of creation itself, which helped lead to its "god particle" nickname. many physicists loathe the term, fretting that it makes their discipline seem self-aggrandising. physicists not connected to fermilab expressed cautious optimism that the long-sought particle had finally been found. "these intriguing hints from the tevatron appear to support the results from the lhc shown at cern in december," said dan tovey, professor of particle physics at the university of sheffield in britain. "the results are particularly important because they use a completely different and complementary way of searching for the higgs boson. this gives us more confidence that what we are seeing is really evidence of new physics rather than just a statistical fluke," tovey added. tovey said scientists will have to wait until wednesday (local time) for the latest results from the european scientists before "getting the full picture" concerning the higgs boson. ad feedback 'a nice result' cern spokesman james gillies called fermilab's findings "a nice result," but added that "it will be interesting to see how it lines up with cern's results on wednesday. nature is the final arbiter so we'll have to be a little more patient before we know for sure whether we've found the higgs." tom lecompte, a scientist at the department of energy's argonne national laboratory in illinois who works at cern and knows the results, said he was confident the higgs would be shown to exist, or not exist, this year. but he would not say if the findings to be unveiled wednesday would be definitive. "i know 2012 is the year. i can't tell you july is the month," lecompte said. others were less cautious. "this is the most exciting week in physics history," said theoretical physicist joe lykken of fermilab. the higgs particle is the final quarry in a hunt that began some 40 years ago, when physicists assembled what is now known as the standard model. the model is considered the culmination of a quest for the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces that determine how they interact, a search that began some 2400 years ago with greek philosopher democritus' hypothesis that everything is composed of indivisible atoms. according to the standard model, matter is composed of various combinations of six leptons, including the well-known electron and the ghostly neutrino, and six quarks, to which physicists have given whimsical names such as "charm," "bottom," and "strange." the protons at the core of atoms, for instance, are composed of two "up" quarks and one "down" quark. the standard model also includes particles dubbed bosons, which carry nature's four basic forces. the best-known boson is the particle of light, the photon. it carries the electromagnetic force, which is responsible for such everyday phenomena as the scent of a rose and the pull of a magnet. another boson is called the gluon. it binds together the quarks that constitute protons. without gluons, quarks would stick together no better than an undercooked souffle, atoms would not exist, and neither would stars, planets or life. particle accelerators such as those at cern and fermilab methodically discovered all the particles predicted by the standard model except one. square one the hold-out is the higgs boson, and its refusal to show itself has long frustrated physicists. the higgs particle is needed to complete and validate the standard model, since if it turns out not to exist scientists would have to figure out the constituents and mechanics of the universe from square one. just as importantly, the existence of higgs was postulated in 1964 to serve a crucial function: conferring mass on some particles that would otherwise have none. technically, the higgs particle itself does not provide mass; the particle is, instead, a little knot of matter squeezed out of a force field like a curd forming in soured milk. the force field is called - of course - the higgs field. the higgs field gives mass to some particles but leaves others alone, in a process one might compare to making cotton candy. as the wand is passed through the gossamer cloud of spun sugar, it holds onto more and more of the pink strands. in much the same way, particles passing through the higgs field picked up more and more mass, until they became the quarks and leptons and bosons that constitute the stuff of today's cosmos. in this analogy, some wands are oiled, preventing sugar from sticking; these particles remain without mass. other wands are super-sticky, picking up more than their fair share of mass. the particle is named after peter higgs, now 83, of the university of edinburgh in britain, but five other physicists came up with the same idea almost simultaneously. "the god particle" was the title of a 1993 book by leon lederman, a nobel-winning physicist and former head of fermilab, and science writer dick teresi. the publisher vetoed titles with "higgs" or anything else too esoteric. lederman later said he wanted to call the book "the goddamned particle" because the higgs was so elusive. fermilab began its higgs quest 10 years ago, using its four-mile circumference tevatron to smash together protons and their anti-matter twins, anti-protons. when matter meets anti-matter, the two annihilate, leaving behind pure energy. out of that energy crystallise new particles. it was in this debris that the tevatron scientists sought evidence of the higgs boson. because the higgs is hypothesised to exist for a mere fraction of a second before decaying into other particles, the strategy was to look for these "daughter" particles. cern's 16.7-mile circumference lhc, which smashes protons against protons at nearly the speed of light, looks for two high-energy photons. the tevatron looked for two bottom quarks. before budget cuts forced it to shut down last september after trillions of proton-anti-proton collisions, it found as many as 1000 pairs that could have come from higgs particles. "it is a real cliffhanger," said physicist gregorio bernardi of the nuclear physics laboratory of high energies in paris and leader of one of the tevatron experiments. "we know exactly what signal we are looking for in our data, and we see some evidence for the production and decay of higgs bosons in a crucial decay mode with a pair of bottom quarks. so we are very excited." the tevatron results indicate that the higgs particle has a mass between 118 and 132 giga-electron volts (the unit of mass-energy used in physics in which 1 gev is about the mass of the proton). last year, the lhc pegged the mass at between 115 and 127 gev. - reuters

T	tension builds over 'god particle' update - europe - al jazeera english
C	tension builds over 'god particle' update scientists hunting the elusive subatomic "higgs" particle will unveil findings that take them nearer to understanding how the big bang at the dawn of time gave rise to stars, planets and even life. physicists who have been smashing particles together at near light-speed at the cern laboratory near geneva have already seen tantalising glimpses of the "higgs boson", the missing piece of the fundamental theory of physics known as the standard model. the world of science now awaits a mass of evidence big enough to be deemed a formal discovery. the secrecy surrounding wednesday's announcement has fuelled speculation that nearly 40 years of research have reached a climax. cern accidentally released a video on its website briefly overnight announcing a "new particle" had been observed, but its representatives declined to comment on whether that was what would be announced later in the day. "this video was released due to a technical glitch on our side here at cern. the final results have not yet been released," cern press officer renilde vanden broeck said in melbourne. she said the organisation had prepared several videos for a range of outcomes for wednesday's announcement. a cern physicist who knows what will be announced said the discovery was not necessarily definitive. "this is not a black and white answer which you should expect. this is an important stepping stone," peter jenni, former spokesman for the atlas collaboration, one part of the cern research organisation, told reuters news agency on wednesday. data harvested from cern's large hadron collider, the biggest particle accelerator in the world, could also shed light on the make-up of the poorly understood "dark matter" and "dark energy" that make up 96 per cent of the universe. it may even point the way to research into the possibility of parallel universes. cern is planning to beam the announcement live around the world to a physics conference in melbourne, australia. related events are planned in countries involved in the project, including britain. the unusual level of stage management has fuelled the sense that big news is in store. on monday, us physicists said they had found the strongest evidence yet of the existence of the higgs in a mass of data collected from the now-mothballed tevatron particle accelerator, run by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago. "it will be interesting to see how it lines up with cern's results on wednesday," said cern spokesman james gillies. some scientists working on the project have told reuters they expect the unveiling of a formal discovery while others expect it to fall just short. with thousands of physicists involved, divided into two separate teams called atlas and cms, cern insists the full picture will not be clear to anyone until a seminar shortly before wednesday's announcement. "even cern's director general won't know much before the seminar reveals the exact results," said pauline gagnon, a canadian particle physicist working on atlas. "they are being finalised at the last minute after much scrutiny." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. scientists say the existence of dark matter and dark energy suggests the standard model, if validated by a higgs discovery, is just the first layer of a more complex theory that includes the vast bulk of the universe that is now poorly understood. "the standard model has a few major flaws; the higgs boson discovery would only fix one of them," said gagnon. in a tale of politics, power and greed, this two-part series examines the mubarak family.

T	always have green tree in your heart singing bird will surly come: the higgs boson: evolution or revolution?
C	press office ? backgrounders editor's note: this article was written to coincide with the higgs update on 13 december 2011 the search for the higgs boson puts particle physics on the threshold of a new era. discovering the higgs particle at the lhc would be a triumph, but showing that it doesn't exist could be at least as exciting, perhaps heralding a revolution in our understanding of nature at a fundamental level. after two good years of operation at the lhc, the moment of truth is drawing near. by the end of the 2012 lhc run at the latest, we'll know whether the simplest incarnation of the higgs particle is real, or just a chimera. whatever the case, many more years of research at the lhc will be needed to fully get to grips with the consequences. finding the higgs particle, or definitively ruling out its existence, is one of the top priorities for research at the lhc. the higgs particle is associated with the simplest realization of a mechanism, proposed in the mid-1960s by robert brout, fran?ois englert, peter higgs and others, which was put forward to explain why one of nature's fundamental forces has a very short range, while another similar force has an infinite range. the forces in question are the electromagnetic force, which carries light to us from the stars, drives electricity around our homes, and gives structure to the atoms and molecules from which we are all made, and the weak force, which drives the energy generating processes of the stars. today we know that the electromagnetic force is carried by particles called photons, which have no mass, whereas the weak force is carried by particles called w and z, which do have mass. rather like people passing a ball, interacting particles exchange these force carriers. the heavier the ball, the shorter the distance it can be thrown; the heavier the force carrier, the shorter its range. the w and z particles were discovered in a nobel prize winning enterprise at cern in the 1980s, but the mechanism that gives rise to their mass has not yet been experimentally identified, and that's where the higgs particle comes in. the higgs mechanism in its basic form is the simplest theoretical model that could account for the mass difference between photons and the w and z particles, and by extension could account for the masses of a range of fundamental particles. but the simplest form of the higgs mechanism is not the only possible explanation. there are many others, linked to theories such as supersymmetry, which could account for the mysterious dark matter of the universe, or theories predicting extra dimensions of space, which, if verified, would truly revolutionise our understanding of the universe we live in. these searches in turn are just a part of the very wide programme of research that is ongoing at the lhc, which also includes looking for the subtle imbalance in nature between matter and antimatter that has allowed the matter we are made of to exist, and studying matter as it would have been in the first instants of the universe's life. the basic form of the higgs mechanism forms part of the standard model of particle physics, the theory developed in the 1960s and 70s that describes the behaviour of fundamental particles and has since been thoroughly tested at laboratories such as cern. the standard model works extremely well, but we know that it cannot be a complete theory. it describes beautifully the ordinary matter from which we, and the entire visible universe, are made. but it does not describe the invisible 96% of the universe that we know to be there, but which has thus far evaded detection. the standard model is nevertheless such a good theory that it will always remain valid over the range it has been tested. today's scientists are therefore looking for a theory that builds on the standard model, rather like einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity, builds on newtonian gravity. that's why finding an alternative to the standard model higgs particle would be so exciting. the standard model higgs particle, if it exists, has well-defined properties that depend only on its mass. that's why it will be possible to confirm or refute its existence before the end of 2012. some of the possible non-standard model higgs particles would look very much like the standard model variety, but could emerge more rarely from lhc collisions and therefore take longer to find. others would be heavier than the lhc's current reach, and require more energy to produce. if such particles are nature's choice, we'll have to wait until the lhc moves to its full design energy to find out. whatever the case, the lhc will make a discovery about the nature of the masses of the fundamental particles. that's because another shortcoming of the standard model is that without the higgs particle, or something that does the same job, its calculations of particle processes break down at the energies the lhc will reach in its second phase of running starting around 2014. that means that if the lhc does not discover the higgs particle by 2012, it is heading towards a discovery later. whatever mechanism nature uses, the lhc will bring us insights. the status of the search for the standard model higgs particle at the end of the 2011 lhc proton run in october was based on experimental work involving scientists from around the world. direct searches from cern's previous flagship research facility, the large electron positron collider, lep, had excluded the mass range up to 114 gev. results from the tevatron collider at fermilab in the usa, and from the lhc, had excluded the range from 141 gev to 476 gev. indirect searches, in which scientists try to detect tell tale signs that a higgs particle has influenced their measurements rather than looking for the particle directly, exclude the range above 200 gev or so. that left just the region 114-141 gev, which is precisely where theoretical and experimental considerations say a standard model higgs particle is most likely to be. by december 2011, analyses by the atlas and cms collaborations had further narrowed the range of masses available for the standard model higgs particle to just 116-127 gev, with both experiments seeing tantalising signs that that a standard model higgs particle might be starting to emerge in the region of 124-126 gev. only time will tell. all of this augurs very well for the long-term future of the lhc programme, since whatever form the higgs particle takes, studying its properties, or examining its absence, will require considerable amounts of data. a standard model-like higgs particle could yet point the way to new physics through subtleties in its behaviour that would only emerge after studying a large number of higgs particles. a standard model-like higgs particle might also be one of several types of higgs particles, pointing the way to new physics, and this would only become apparent after detailed scrutiny. a non-standard model higgs particle linked to a theory like supersymmetry that goes beyond the standard model would immediately open the door to new physics. and finally, if a standard model higgs particle were definitively ruled out at the lhc's current operating energy, that would point either to a non-standard higgs particle that could be discovered with more luminosity or to the existence of new physics at the lhc's full design energy where the standard model without the higgs particle starts to break down. whatever form the higgs particle takes, or whatever mechanism drives the differences in fundamental particle masses, finding it is not a simple case of spotting the telltale signs and shouting eureka! it is a painstaking process of statistical analyses based on measuring specific configurations of particles emerging from collisions. for example, one of the ways a higgs particle can decay is into two photons, which would be detected. however, there are many other processes that also produce two photons, so the searches compare the number of so-called two-photon events measured with the number expected from already known processes. they do this for all the possible decay modes, and only when they see a statistically significant excess can scientists claim a discovery. in particle physics, people talk of 95% confidence levels, which means that a given signal, such as that for a higgs particle decaying to two photons, has only a 5% chance of being due to a statistical fluctuation. however, 95% confidence is not enough to claim a discovery, for that, the probability of a statistical fluctuation being responsible for the measurement has to be much smaller, say, than one in a million. this is what physicists call a five-sigma effect. discovery or exclusion of a standard model higgs particle to that level of confidence is what's on the cards for 2012 at the latest. a non-standard model higgs particle could take longer to be discovered, but would certainly be worth the wait. either way, there will be much work ahead for the lhc scientists to fully understand the new physics that is just over the horizon.

T	higgs-like leak? video says new particle observed at lhc - cosmic log
C	recommended: researchers capture shadow cast by a single atom recommended: higgs-like leak? video says new particle observed at lhc recommended: has the higgs boson been found? signs point to ... almost time pubdate datetime="2012-07-03t14:12:32-04:00"> ago higgs-like leak? video says new particle observed at lhc the compact muon solenoid, or cms, dwarfs workers at the large hadron collider during construction work in 2007. a leader of the cms' scientific team says in a cern video that physicists have observed a new particle that may have characteristics consistent with the higgs boson. follow @b0yle a mistakenly leaked video from europe's cern particle-physics center reports that a new subatomic particle has been observed at the large hadron collider , in the range where the long-sought higgs boson is expected to lurk. the video has now been put into password-protected status, and cern says viewers shouldn't "take anything for granted" until a much-anticipated seminar on the higgs boson hunt takes place on wednesday. "we've observed a new particle. ... we have quite strong evidence that there's something there," joe incandela, spokesperson for the lhc's cms experiment, said in the video, which was discovered by science news on cern's website. "so, to ascertain its properties is still going to take us a little bit of time." incandela said the particle has some of the characteristics associated with the higgs boson, which plays a key role in hypotheses that explain why some subatomic particles have mass while others don't. finding the higgs is a key target of the $10 billion lhc project. its discovery could open the way to new frontiers in physics, such as the study of extra dimensions and supersymmetry. consistent with the higgs the physicist said that the particle decayed into two photons, in a way consistent with higgs' behavior. he also said it's 130 times as massive as a proton - which is within the expected mass range for the higgs. "this is very significant," said incandela, a physicist from the university of california at santa barbara who was the first u.s. scientist to be elected spokesperson for an lhc experiment . "this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all of this, which i think we will. ... this is something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest discoveries, or observations, of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks." cms spokesperson joe incandela reports in a cern video that a new particle has been observed at europe's large hadron collider. if the particle's characteristics correspond to the predictions provided by some of the theories on the frontier of physics, "then we're really seeing something very, very closely tied to the fabric of space and time, something that's really fundamental to the universe, and that represents a major discovery, perhaps as big as the discovery of quarks, perhaps as big as the discovery of antimatter," incandela said. incandela characterized the cms team's find as "very strong evidence," but he downplayed the use of the word "discovery" - a word that physicists reserve only for the most solid findings, with only one chance out of 3 million that the result is a statistical fluke. instead, he emphasized the term "observation," which he said means that the particle is "definitely there, and it's very unlikely to go away." he said the particle could be the kind of higgs boson that fits perfectly with the existing theory of particle physics, the standard model, or it could be an unorthodox type of particle that doesn't fit the model. "if that's the case, then we have something really profound here," he said. "it could be a gateway to the next phase of exploring the deepest parts of the fabric of our universe." he emphasized that cms' results were only preliminary, and did not refer to any claims from the atlas collaboration, the other team most heavily involved in the search for the higgs. but he did say he expected the results to be sufficiently confirmed to lead to a scientific publication by the end of july. "we're very excited," incandela said. a tipoff? or a red herring? the video, which was dated july 4, appeared to provide a tipoff to the announcement planned for wednesday. incandela's comments reflected what the pre-announcement buzz has been: that the cms and atlas teams observed an anomalous particle with the characteristics of the higgs, with a confidence level close to that required to claim a discovery. however, this was just one video interview with one senior researcher, and it's not clear how much the video will reflect what the team leaders will say at the seminar. when the video came to light, outside physicists cautioned that the full story may turn out to be different. "really, we need to see atlas and cms data side by side, e.g., are peaks in the same places?" theoretical physicist robert garisto, an editor at physical review letters, told me in a twitter conversation. on the other hand, he said, "i wouldn't bet against the higgs now." physicists at cern, a nuclear research facility in switzerland, are expected to announce that they have finally found the higgs boson, a subatomic particle. derrick pitts, chief astronomer at the franklin institute, discusses. cern spokesman james gillies struck a similar note of caution. he told me today that the incandela interview was "one of several videos that we recorded to cover all the bases." cern tried to keep all of the advance videos password-protected, to guard against premature release, but "one of them became visible for a short period of time ... we don't know why." follow @cosmiclog the atlas and cms teams, from their spokespersons on down, are trying to abide by wednesday's embargo on their findings. "until the seminar tomorrow, don't take anything for granted," gillies told me. you can watch cern's webcast of the particle-physics fireworks beginning at 3 a.m. et. update for 2:30 p.m. et: credit for spotting the video on the cern website goes to nasa's super guppy delivers piece of space shuttle history to seattle (63)

"this is a very, very preliminary result, but we think it's very strong," said joe incandela, spokesperson for the cms experiment at cern's large hadron collider. hundreds thronged to an auditorium at the cern particle-physics center near geneva to hear the latest from the lhc, and thousands more watched the proceedings on computers and big screens around the world. the timing of today's briefings was most convenient for europeans as well as researchers attending the international conference on high-energy physics in australia, but video-viewing parties were organized as well in the middle of the night for scientists and science fans in the united states. "as a layman, i would say, i think we have it," cern director general rolf heuer told the audience in the auditorium. "do you agree?" his question was greeted with wild applause. the advance buzz suggested that researchers would report observations of a previously unknown particle that fit the characteristics of the higgs boson. last december, the teams behind the lhc's atlas and cms experiments reported seeing "tantalizing hints" of the higgs, and since then, the experiments have doubled the amount of data collected from hundreds of trillions of proton collisions at higher energies. the results presented by incandela were in line with expectations. "we have observed a new boson," he reported. incandela set the mass level of the new particle at 125.3 billion electron volts, or 125.3 gev, plus or minus 0.6 gev. results from the atlas experiment also pointed to "clear signs of a new particle" in the range of 126.5 gev, spokesperson fabiola gianotti said in a statement . the two experiments serve as backups for each other, and the fact that the same phenomenon was observed at both detectors added to the solidity of the claims. physicists said more data would have to be collected to confirm that the particle was truly the higgs. "to say you've discovered the higgs ... it's a complicated story," cern theoretical physicist john ellis said in a video prepared in advance of today's briefings. "it's one thing to see evidence of a new particle, but you have to check whether it has the right properties. and to check whether it has the right properties will actually take quite a bit of extra work." after today's announcement, heuer alluded to the work ahead. "we have observed a new particle consistent with the higgs boson," he said. "which one? that remains open." $10 billion effort identifying and studying the higgs boson is the main objective of the $10 billion lhc project. it's the only fundamental subatomic particle predicted by the current theory on the subatomic structure of the cosmos, known as the standard model, which has yet to be found. it was hypothesized back in the 1960s, by british physicist peter higgs and others, as part of a mechanism to explain why some particles have mass while others don't. "if the new particle is determined to be the higgs, attention will turn to a new set of important questions," university of california irvine physicist andy lankford, the deputy spokesperson for the atlas experiment, said in a statement. "is this a standard model higgs, or is it a variant that indicates new physics and other new particles?" in that scenario, a confirmed discovery of the higgs would open the way for studies delving into some of the weirder corners of physics, such as the idea that our universe has six or seven extra dimensions, or the claim that there should be an unseen supersymmetric partner for every one of the subatomic particles that have been detected, or the stuff that mysterious dark matter is made of. the discovery would also send peter higgs, who is still active in the field at the age of 83, to the top of the line for a nobel prize in physics. higgs and several other physicists involved in formulating the theory were in attendance at today's cern briefing. to claim a formal discovery, the results from the lhc had to reach a confidence level of 5 sigma, which means there'd be just one chance in 3 million that the findings are a statistical fluke. earlier this week, researchers at fermilab in illinois shared what they said were their final results from the tevatron collider, which has been eclipsed by the lhc and was shut down last year. the results of their higgs quest came up to a level of only 2.5 sigma - not enough to count as a true discovery. follow @cosmiclog today, incandela announced that the results from the cms detector in one of the expected decay modes for the higgs boson had a "combined significance of 5 standard deviations." word of that measurement was greeted with applause in the cern auditorium. "it's nice to be at 5," incandela said. other results from cms, however, fell just short of the 5-sigma standard - and in at least one decay mode, the expected signs of the higgs were not present at all. that could be just a fluke in the data, but incandela said the analysis would continue with even more readings. when all the results were combined, the confidence level for cms was set at 4.9 sigma, he said. gianotti, meanwhile, said the combined results from the atlas experiment reached 5 sigma, signaling a discovery. that revelation, too, drew applause. "this is just the beginning," gianotti said. "there is more to come." in a news release, cern said the results would be published in a scientific journal around the end of the month, and more data would lead to firmer conclusions by the end of the year. b0yle account on twitter . statements on the particle discovery: cern director general rolf heuer: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature. the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." cern research director sergio bertolucci: "it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data." energy secretary steven chu:"i congratulate the thousands of scientists around the globe for their outstanding work in searching for the higgs boson. today's announcement on the latest results of this search shows the benefits of sustained investments in basic science by governments around the world. scientists have been looking for the higgs particle for more than two decades; these results help validate the standard model used by scientists to explain the nature of matter." nigel lockyer, director of canada's triumf particle physics lab: "with atlas and the lhc, we set sail in the direction toward what we thought was the land of the higgs. last december, we saw a smudge on the horizon and knew we could be getting close to land. with these latest results, we've seen the shoreline! we know we'll make it to dry land, but the ship is not in to shore just yet." some of the (other) blogs to watch for higgs boson updates: vixra.org: physicist philip gibbs blogs about boson buzz. not even wrong: columbia physicist peter woit's blog.

"it's one thing to see evidence of a new particle, but you have to check whether it has the right properties. and to check whether it has the right properties will actually take quite a bit of extra work." $10 billion effort identifying and studying the higgs boson is the main objective of the $10 billion lhc project. it's the only fundamental subatomic particle predicted by the current theory on the subatomic structure of the cosmos, known as the standard model, which has yet to be found. it was hypothesized back in the 1960s, by british physicist peter higgs and others, as part of a mechanism to explain why some particles have mass while others don't. "if the new particle is determined to be the higgs, attention will turn to a new set of important questions," university of california irvine physicist andy lankford, the deputy spokesperson for the atlas experiment, said in a statement. "is this a standard model higgs, or is it a variant that indicates new physics and other new particles?" in that scenario, a confirmed discovery of the higgs would open the way for studies delving into some of the weirder corners of physics, such as the idea that our universe has six or seven extra dimensions, or the claim that there should be an unseen supersymmetric partner for every one of the subatomic particles that have been detected, or the stuff that mysterious dark matter is made of. the discovery would also send peter higgs, who is still active in the field at the age of 83, to the top of the line for a nobel prize in physics. higgs and several other physicists involved in formulating the theory were in attendance at today's cern briefing. hto claim a formal discovery, the results from the lhc had to reach a confidence level of 5 sigma, which means there'd be just one chance in 3 million that the findings are a statistical fluke. earlier this week, researchers at fermilab in illinois shared what they said were their final results from the tevatron collider, which has been eclipsed by the lhc and was shut down last year. the results of their higgs quest came up to a level of only 2.5 sigma - not enough to count as a true discovery. follow @cosmiclog today, incandela announced that the results from the cms detector in one of the expected decay modes for the higgs boson had a "combined significance of 5 standard deviations." word of that measurement was greeted with applause in the cern auditorium. "it's nice to be at 5," incandela said. other results from cms, however, fell just short of the 5-sigma standard - and in at least one decay mode, the expected signs of the higgs were not present at all. that could be just a fluke in the data, but incandela said the analysis would continue with even more readings. when all the results were combined, the confidence level for cms was set at 4.9 sigma, he said. gianotti, meanwhile, said the combined results from the atlas experiment reached 5 sigma, signaling a discovery. that revelation, too, drew applause. in a news release, cern said the results would be published in a scientific journal around the end of the month, and more data would lead to firmer conclusions by the end of the year. b0yle account on twitter . statements on the particle discovery: cern director general rolf heuer: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature. the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." cern research director sergio bertolucci: "it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data." energy secretary steven chu: "i congratulate the thousands of scientists around the globe for their outstanding work in searching for the higgs boson. today's announcement on the latest results of this search shows the benefits of sustained investments in basic science by governments around the world. scientists have been looking for the higgs particle for more than two decades; these results help validate the standard model used by scientists to explain the nature of matter." some of the (other) blogs to watch for higgs boson updates: vixra.org: physicist philip gibbs blogs about boson buzz. not even wrong: columbia physicist peter woit's blog.

"it's nice to be at 5," incandela said. other results from cms, however, fell just short of the 5-sigma standard - and in at least one decay mode, the expected signs of the higgs were not present at all. that could be just a fluke in the data, but incandela said the analysis would continue with more readings. when all the results were combined, the confidence level for cms was set at 4.9 sigma, he said. gianotti, meanwhile, said the combined results from the atlas experiment reached 5 sigma, signaling a discovery. that revelation, too, drew applause. in at least one of the decay modes, the readings from atlas were much higher that what would be expected for the standard model higgs - but it's too early to tell whether that is merely a statistical anomaly or the sign of an unexpected twist that theorists will have to wrestle with. "this is just the beginning," gianotti said. "there is more to come." in a news release, cern said the results would be published in a scientific journal around the end of the month, and more data would lead to firmer conclusions by the end of the year. statements on the particle discovery: cern director general rolf heuer: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature. the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." cern research director sergio bertolucci: "it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data." energy secretary steven chu:"i congratulate the thousands of scientists around the globe for their outstanding work in searching for the higgs boson. today's announcement on the latest results of this search shows the benefits of sustained investments in basic science by governments around the world. scientists have been looking for the higgs particle for more than two decades; these results help validate the standard model used by scientists to explain the nature of matter." nigel lockyer, director of canada's triumf particle physics lab: "with atlas and the lhc, we set sail in the direction toward what we thought was the land of the higgs. last december, we saw a smudge on the horizon and knew we could be getting close to land. with these latest results, we've seen the shoreline! we know we'll make it to dry land, but the ship is not in to shore just yet." some of the (other) blogs to watch for higgs boson updates: vixra.org: physicist philip gibbs blogs about boson buzz. not even wrong: columbia physicist peter woit's blog.
Q	this is a very, very preliminary result, but we think it's very strong,
Q	as a layman, i would now say, i think we have it,
Q	do you agree?
Q	tantalizing hints
Q	we have observed a new boson,
Q	clear signs of a new particle
Q	to say you've discovered the higgs ... it's a complicated story,
Q	it's one thing to see evidence of a new particle, but you have to check whether it has the right properties. and to check whether it has the right properties will actually take quite a bit of extra work.
Q	we have to find out which kind of higgs boson this is. ... we have discovered a boson, and now we have to determine what kind of boson it is,
Q	ask me in three, four years,
Q	if that [higgs boson] would not exist, then you would not exist,
Q	the last missing cornerstone
Q	if the new particle is determined to be the higgs, attention will turn to a new set of important questions,
Q	is this a standard model higgs, or is it a variant that indicates new physics and other new particles?
Q	to me, it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime,
Q	combined significance of 5 standard deviations.
Q	it's nice to be at 5,
Q	this is just the beginning,
Q	there is more to come.
Q	we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature. the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe.
Q	it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data.
Q	with atlas and the lhc, we set sail in the direction toward what we thought was the land of the higgs. last december, we saw a smudge on the horizon and knew we could be getting close to land. with these latest results, we've seen the shoreline! we know we'll make it to dry land, but the ship is not in to shore just yet.

T	local physicists part of team to discover 'god particle'
C	this undated image made available by cern shows a typical candidate event including two high-energy photons whose energy (depicted by red towers) is measured in the cms electromagnetic calorimeter. the yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision. the pale blue volume shows the cms crystal calorimeter barrel. to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday july 4, 2012, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. local physicists part of team to discover 'god particle' the higgs boson is an infinitessimally small particle that is a mighty big deal, say physicists from nebraska and iowa who have been part of the effort to confirm the existence of the long-theorized building block of the universe. "it influences all the other particles that make up matter as we know it," explained greg snow, a physics professor and associate dean for research at the university of nebraska-lincoln. he is part of a team of unl researchers helping in the hunt for the higgs boson. on wednesday, physicists at cern, the european center for nuclear research in geneva, switzerland, announced that they have observed a particle that appears to be the elusive higgs boson. the finding would mark the last missing piece of the standard model, a theory particle physicists have used since the mid-20th century to account for all the known forces and subatomic particles in the universe. janet seger, chairman of the physics department at creighton university, described the finding as astonishing and beautiful - astonishing because scientists have been able to accumulate evidence on the existence of particles that are tinier than atoms, and beautiful in its confirmation of long-accepted theory. "it's almost a philosophical, spiritual sense," she said. "we've been operating on the assumption that this is true for a long time. this does give us confirmation that we understand the world in which we live. it's beautiful in that way." named after scottish physicist peter higgs, the higgs boson had been the only remaining fundamental particle described in the standard model theory whose existence had not been confirmed through experiments. seventeen years had passed since scientists confirmed the last particle, called a top quark. researchers in nebraska and iowa have been among the thousands worldwide to aid in the search using cern's large hadron collider, the world's largest particle smasher. built in 2008 for $6.2 billion, it weighs 38,000 metric tons. it accelerates two beams in opposite directions through a 16.5-mile circular tunnel built 110 yards below the surface near the swiss-french border near geneva. nobel laureate and physicist leon lederman coined the particle's nickname in his 1993 book, "the god particle: if the universe is the answer, what is the question?" many scientists aren't entirely comfortable with the term because of its religious overtones. however, snow says the phrase is apt in the sense of the simple and important role the higgs boson plays in understanding matter. "why does any object have mass, weight and size?" he asked rhetorically. "what is the universe? why does matter have weight and fill up space? those are the fundamental things we think about." the cern announcement, kicking off the international conference on high energy physics in australia, comes on the heels of a similar announcement monday by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago. scientists at the fermi lab said they found hints of the higgs boson in debris left from trillions of collisions between beams of protons and anti-protons at the smaller tevatron accelerator, now shut down. snow cautioned that cern scientists stop short of saying they have discovered the higgs boson. "what we're announcing is the observation of a new particle whose properties seem to be consistent with it being the higgs boson," he said. "it walks like a duck and it squawks like a duck, but there's not yet sufficient evidence to say with certainty." the particle resembles the higgs boson in three key ways, snow said. the frequency with which it's being created matches the expectations for the higgs boson; its mass is within the range of what's expected; and it decays rapidly and leaves the anticipated trace particles in its wake. about a dozen unl researchers are working on the cms experiment, one of two cern experiments focusing on the higgs boson, snow said. they include five faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduate students. a team of iowa state university researchers work on the other higgs experiment at cern, known as the atlas experiment. creighton university also has physicists who regularly work at the cern laboratory, though they are not directly involved in the search for the higgs boson. rather, their work on the alice experiment seeks quark gluon plasma, the matter believed to have existed immediately after the big bang and the beginning of the universe. with thousands of people involved in the research from all over the world, each research group has clearly defined assignments, snow said. the unl team helped make a tracking detector that helped identify the traces left by the particle. unl provided a large-scale computing farm - one of only seven in the country - that processed data generated by the experiment, and unl researchers helped analyze the data that led to the observation of the new particle. though confirming the particle's existence may not result in a cure for cancer or drought-resistant corn, the research gives unl faculty and students a front-row seat on the frontiers of physics, snow said. "this is cutting-edge research at the forefront of the field of particle physics," he said. "it's a thrill to provide students, especially, the opportunity to be right at the cutting edge of a frontier research field. during a weathercast in baltimore, the graphic behind the weatherman gave the temperature as 775 degrees. everyone knows temperatures back east peaked at 608 degrees. a unl grad who was married in wisconsin had a groom's cake that was a replica of memorial stadium in lincoln. it was so authentic, the student section was in the reception hall across the street. hundreds of veterans who served our country between 1946 and 1992 will march or ride from the centurylink center to td ameritrade park. a man has begun a walk across the united states. so apparently he's familiar with what usually happens to gas prices on the fourth of july. the 2011 goodfellows fund drive provided holiday meals to nearly 5,000 families and their children, and raised more than $500,000 to help families in crisis year round.

C	laboratory accidentally posts video heralding discovery of a new particle on its website ahead of scheduled announcement a wall painting at cern shows how a higgs boson might look. photograph: anja niedringhaus/ap the cern physics laboratory near geneva appeared to leak crucial details of its hunt for the long-sought higgs boson particle on tuesday when it senior scientists at cern are due to reveal the latest findings in the hunt for the famed particle at a much-anticipated press conference in geneva on wednesday, and had tried to keep the results under wraps, despite intense rumours that the laboratory had found the particle. but cern, which takes credit for inventing the world wide web, inadvertently released a video interview on its website dated 4 july 2012 in which spokesman joe incandela states the lab has "observed a new particle". a press officer at the laboratory blamed a technical glitch for the video going live. the interview was taken down shortly after. speaking on the video, incandela stopped short of claiming the particle was the higgs boson, saying more work was needed to be sure. "we have quite strong evidence that there's something there. it's properties are still going to take us a little bit of time," he said. the details incandela revealed suggest it has the hallmarks of the higgs particle. "we can see that it decays into two photons, for example, which tells us it's a boson, it's a particle with integer spin, and we know its mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the proton. and this is very significant. "this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all this, which i think we will," he said. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks," he added. a spokesperson for cern said the video went live on the internet due to a "technical fault". they added that the lab had recorded several videos in advance with spokespersons at the lab. two teams of physicists at cern are preparing to announce their latest efforts to discover the higgs boson at a press conference at the laboratory on wednesday morning. details will be unveiled by fabiola gianotti and incandela, the respective leaders of teams that use the giant atlas and cms detectors to search for new particles. the higgs boson, named after the edinburgh university physicist peter higgs, who proposed it in 1964, has become the most sought-after particle in modern science and its discovery is a major focus of research at the lhc. discovery of the particle would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space. without it, or something to do its job, there would be no stars, planets or life as we know it. according to theory, the higgs field switched on a trillionth of a second after the big bang that flung the universe into existence. before this moment, all of the particles in the universe were massless and zipped around at the speed of light. when the higgs field switched on, it changed the future of the universe. particles such as the quarks and electrons that make up normal matter felt a "drag" from the field, which manifests itself as mass. the more a particle feels the field, the heavier it becomes. some particles, like photons, pass through the field untouched, and so remain massless and move at the speed of light. some theories known as "supersymmetry" predict the existence of several kinds of higgs particles, along with a host of other particles that have yet to be discovered.

C	physicists who have been smashing particles together at near light-speed at the cern laboratory near geneva have already seen tantalising glimpses of the "higgs boson", the missing piece of the fundamental theory of physics known as the standard model. the world of science now awaits a mass of evidence big enough to be deemed a formal discovery. scientists at cern, the european organization for nuclear research, are presenting their latest results at a seminar this morning . the secrecy surrounding today's announcement has fuelled speculation that nearly 40 years of research have reached a climax. in december 2011, cern announced that it had inconclusive hints of the higgs boson. the european organization for nuclear research accidentally released a video on its website briefly overnight announcing a "new particle" had been observed, but cern representatives declined to comment on whether that was what would be announced later in the day. "this video was released due to a technical glitch on our side here at cern. the final results have not yet been released," cern press officer renilde vanden broeck said in melbourne. she said the organisation had prepared several videos for a range of outcomes. a cern physicist who knows what will be announced said the discovery was not necessarily definitive. "this is not a black and white answer which you should expect. this is an important stepping stone," peter jenni, former spokesman for the atlas collaboration, one part of the cern research organisation said. data harvested from cern's large hadron collider, the biggest particle accelerator in the world, could also shed light on the make-up of the poorly understood "dark matter" and "dark energy" that make up 96% of the universe. it may even point the way to research into the possibility of parallel universes. cern is planning to beam the announcement live around the world to a physics conference in melbourne, australia. related events are planned in countries involved in the project, including britain. drew nelson makes the first orange order address to the seanad. watch in full a new tourism initiative has been launched in co clare, aiming to improve the welcome given to visitors in the county this year's 'an spud-off m?r', which seeks out the best potato in the country, has taken place in co kerry labour td kevin humphreys fears the large sums of punts being exchanged are the proceeds of crime morning ireland discusses what the long-promised legislation will mean for distressed mortgage holders a story of love in the 21st century - online dating. he's in dublin, she's in america. can true love be found? south african freedom fighter kader asmal lived in exile in dublin for nearly 30 years and founded the irish anti-apartheid movement an exploration of the recent arrival of many diverse religions along the border counties of ireland for almost 40 years, a group of women in co cork have met once a month to discuss a book rt? is not responsible for the content of external internet sites.

C	'we've observed a new particle': cern announces that it has found higgs boson scientists 'will say they are 99.99% certain' the particle has been found leading physicists have been invited to event - sparking speculation that higgs boson particle has been found 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass could be end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle by rob waugh published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 02:28 est, 4 july 2012 comments ( 0 ) share the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that lends mass to matter and holds the universe together - could soon be over. cern scientists have observed a particle that matches their expectations of the higgs boson. hundreds of scientists have filed into a conference room at cern in switzerland to hear an announcement on the particle collider's progress. a leaked video reportedly from cern showed lab spokesman joe incandela saying 'we've observed a new particle ... we have quite strong evidence that there's something there.' scroll down for live video the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle invite: peter higgs, the professor the particle is named after, has been asked to attend the press conference at cern 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years.' almost, but not quite. the process of proving the higgs is real is a gradual one - and the standards for an official 'scientific discovery' are extremely high. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' would be the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. in this case, the chances of a mistake are one in a million. today the scientists at cern, the european organisation for nuclear research in geneva, are likely to announce a significant step further towards the five sigma goal. possibly, they might even be at 'four sigma', a hair's-breadth away from having the higgs in their grasp. in that case the final 'discovery' of the higgs particle will be virtually a foregone conclusion. cern's director for research and computing, sergio bertolucci, said: 'we now have more than double the data we had last year. that should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the 2011 data are still there, or whether they have gone away. it's a very exciting time.' american accelerator also finds evidence for higgs boson physicists at a u.s. laboratory say are also close to proving the existence of the higgs boson. the announcement by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago came two days before physicists at cern are set to unveil their own findings in the higgs hunt. the fermilab scientists found hints of the higgs in the debris from trillions of collisions between beams of protons and anti-protons over 10 years at the lab's now-shuttered tevatron accelerator. but the evidence still fell short of the scientific threshold for proof of the discovery of the particle, they said, in that the same collision debris hinting at the existence of the higgs could also come from other subatomic particles. 'this is the best answer that is out there at the moment,' said physicist rob roser of fermilab, which is run by the u.s. department of energy. 'the tevatron data strongly point toward the existence of the higgs boson, but it will take results from the experiments at the large hadron collider in europe to establish a firm discovery.' physicists not connected to fermilab expressed cautious optimism that the long-sought particle had finally been found. 'these intriguing hints from the tevatron appear to support the results from the lhc shown at cern in december,' said dan tovey, professor of particle physics at the university of sheffield in britain. 'the results are particularly important because they use a completely different and complementary way of searching for the higgs boson. this gives us more confidence that what we are seeing is really evidence of new physics rather than just a statistical fluke,' tovey added. tovey said scientists will have to wait until wednesday for the latest results from the european scientists before 'getting the full picture' concerning the higgs boson. inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. by following the decay patterns, scientists hope to see the 'fingerprint' of the higgs boson. physicists need the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.'

T	scientists to unveil milestone in higgs boson hunt - technology - livemint.com
C	london: scientists hunting the elusive subatomic "higgs" particle will unveil findings on wednesday that take them nearer to understanding how the big bang at the dawn of time gave rise to stars, planets and even life. physicists who have been smashing particles together at near light-speed at the cern laboratory near geneva have already seen tantalising glimpses of the "higgs boson", the missing piece of the fundamental theory of physics known as the standard model. this document provided by european organization for nuclear research (cern) shows a graphic showing traces of two high-energy photons measured in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experience. (afp) the world of science now awaits a mass of evidence big enough to be deemed a formal discovery. the secrecy surrounding wednesday's announcement has fuelled speculation that nearly 40 years of research have reached a climax. cern accidentally released a video on its website briefly overnight announcing a "new particle" had been observed, but cern representatives declined to comment on whether that was what would be announced later in the day. "this video was released due to a technical glitch on our side here at cern. the final results have not yet been released," cern press officer renilde vanden broeck said in melbourne. she said the organisation had prepared several videos for a range of outcomes for wednesday's announcement. a cern physicist who knows what will be announced said the discovery was not necessarily definitive. "this is not a black and white answer which you should expect. this is an important stepping stone," peter jenni, former spokesman for the atlas collaboration, one part of the cern research organisation, told reuters on wednesday. data harvested from cern's large hadron collider, the biggest particle accelerator in the world, could also shed light on the make-up of the poorly understood "dark matter" and "dark energy" that make up 96% of the universe. it may even point the way to research into the possibility of parallel universes. cern is planning to beam the announcement live around the world to a physics conference in melbourne, australia. related events are planned in countries involved in the project, including britain. the unusual level of stage management has fuelled the sense that big news is in store. on monday, us physicists said they had found the strongest evidence yet of the existence of the higgs in a mass of data collected from the now-mothballed tevatron particle accelerator, run by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago. "it will be interesting to see how it lines up with cern's results on wednesday," said cern spokesman james gillies. some scientists working on the project have told reuters they expect the unveiling of a formal discovery while others expect it to fall just short. with thousands of physicists involved, divided into two separate teams called atlas and cms, cern insists the full picture will not be clear to anyone until a seminar shortly before wednesday's announcement. "even cern's director general won't know much before the seminar reveals the exact results," said pauline gagnon, a canadian particle physicist working on atlas. "they are being finalised at the last minute after much scrutiny." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. scientists say the existence of dark matter and dark energy suggests the standard model, if validated by a higgs discovery, is just the first layer of a more complex theory that includes the vast bulk of the universe that is now poorly understood. "the standard model has a few major flaws; the higgs boson discovery would only fix one of them," said gagnon. investigations show that seven gdr issues between 2003 and 2009 did not raise any money from overseas... foreign investors unwinding their exposure in ndf contracts support the rupee's rise consumers are confused by similar products coming out of different companies

T	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle what happens inside the large hadron collider. scientists at cern, near geneva, have this morning announced the likely discovery of the higgs boson particle. photograph: cern 7.17am: good morning all. two teams of physicists at the cern laboratory near geneva are preparing today to announce their latest efforts to discover the participants take a rest early before the opening of the seminar. photograph: denis balibouse/afp/getty images the elusive "god particle" has become the most sought-after particle in modern science. its discovery would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space, and excitement in the scientific community is at fever pitch. peter higgs, the edinburgh university physicist who proposed the idea of the particle in 1964, is flying in to geneva, as are two other men who published similar theories at around the same time: fran?ois englert, professor emeritus at the free university of brussels (ulb) in belgium, and tom kibble, professor emeritus at imperial college london. there have been rumours, speculation, and, last night, even an apparent leak from the laboratory when a the guardian's ian sample has flown to geneva and i'll be live-blogging this potentially historic morning on this page. 7.38am: now, two video links for your viewing pleasure. and here is a video from the guardian's own resident boffin, science correspondent ian sample. heroically, he attempts to explain the higgs boson by means of a tray from our canteen and some coloured ping pong balls. british physicist peter higgs (right) arrives at the seminar. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 7.52am: clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. now, the anticipation mounts. 8.02am: and we're off. first up is joe incandela, the leader of the team using the cms detector to search for new particles. he'll be followed by fabiola gianotti from the other team using the atlas detector. he says the results are "very strong, very solid". 8.13am: as incandela speaks, the brilliant ian sample is live-tweeting from cern. july 4, 2012 and we're keeping our observations extremely serious in keeping with the potentially historic nature of the day. 8.21am: i'm not going to lie: this is a little above my gcse 8.24am: reuters has just posted a flash update that claims cern scientists have discovered a new sub-atomic particle that could be the higgs boson. scientists at the cern research centre have discovered a new subatomic particle that could be the elusive higgs boson, which is believed to be crucial in the formation of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of the uk's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." incandela: says when they combine the results for two decay channels they get five sigma for the 8.43am: more interpretative tweets courtesy of those who can interpret these results. and combined - 5 sigma. round of applause. that's a discovery of a higgs - like particle at cms. they thank lhc for the data! particle physics threshold for discovery. it roughly means that you're 99.9999% sure 8.48am: incandela has finished. there's warm applause. his summary: all channels combined, sensitivity is 4.9 sigma. all results are consistent. his reflection from incandela's presentation is: huge question ongoing: are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new? easiest way to make different channels mismatch is to add new particles to your theory that couple to the higgs, and enter as virtual particles that modify different decay rates. full employment for both experimentalists and theorists! 8.55am: up now is fabiola giannotti, leader of the 3,000-strong group that works on the collider's five-storey atlas detector. a little piece about her and her work at the lhc last year. the appointment put her in the top ranks of a profession dominated by men. she came to physics from an education steeped in ancient greek, philosophy and the history of art - she had also trained as a pianist at the milan conservatory. but she ultimately chose physics to answer the big question of why things are as they are. "physics is, unfortunately, often seen as a male subject; sterile and without charm or emotion," she told the cern magazine. "but this is not true, because physics is art, aesthetics, beauty and symmetry." brian cox. in simple language, cms have discovered a new boson, and it behaves like the standard model higgs 9.05am: ap's take on incandela's presentation. one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom smasher says it has found strong evidence of a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. joe incandela, leader of one of the teams, told scientists at the european center for nuclear research, or cern, that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, popularly referred to as the "god particle." 9.09am: the new scientist, reporting from the auditorium, says cern has pre-empted gianotti. and the results from atlas also look exciting. 9.14am: "both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev," confirms a press release from cern. this release as saying: we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage, but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication. the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks. and sergio bertolucci, research director of cern, says: it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data. the results presented today are labelled preliminary, the statement adds. they are based on data collected in 2011 and 2012, with the 2012 data still under analysis. publication of the analyses shown today is expected around the end of july. a more complete picture of today's observations will emerge later this year after the lhc provides the experiments with more data. the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe. are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient in the standard model of particle physics? or is it something more exotic? the standard model describes the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them. all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about 4% of the total. a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96% of the universe that remains obscure. positive identification of the new particle's characteristics will take considerable time and data. but whatever form the higgs particle takes, our knowledge of the fundamental structure of matter is about to take a major step forward. 9.21am: first reaction from peter higgs has just landed in my inbox. according to a statement sent by edinburgh university, the physicist says he is "astounded" at the speed with which the results have emerged and is preparing to celebrate. scientists at cern are to be congratulated on today's results, which are a great achievement for the large hadron collider and other experiments leading up to this. i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge. participants applaud after the presentation of the atlas experiments. photograph: denis balibouse/ap 9.23am: gianotti is still presenting atlas's results but the reaction is already pouring in. here's are the first few paragraphs from there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , home of the large hadron collider near geneva, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. 9.29am: "#cern" is trending worldwide. as is #higgs, and #godparticle (sorry), and atlas. no #higgsteria yet though, despite a valiant effort by social media types. 9.32am: today's discovery is "unbelievably exciting", according to harvard physicist lisa randall. i really didn't expect this. they got enough data and improved analysis to the point where we know about a new particle months before i expected (based on asking lots of people)! it is unbelievably exciting. , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern, had this evaluation for ian over in geneva: is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion. a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by cern. photograph: afp/getty images atlas - round of applause + cheers. 5 sigma discovery at 126.5 gev standard model expectation would be 4.6 sigma, so compatible with sm prediction july 4, 2012 "i'm not done yet; there's more to come!" she laughs. she has these guys in the palm of her hand. 9.41am: some physicists are being more certain about interpreting these results than others. for professor stefan s?ldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the university of manchester, "there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists". today we have witnessed a discovery which gives unique insight into our understanding of the universe and the origin of the masses of fundamental particles. there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists and we now have to understand its properties and whether it behaves exactly as predicted by theory. this discovery is the first milestone of the lhc physics programme and opens the door to many more exciting discoveries by the lhc experiments in the next decade. 9.44am: rolf heuer, director general of cern, offers this verdict: as a layman i would say: i think we have it. you agree? the audience claps. i think that's a yes. 9.46am: heuer flashes up on screen a slide that says cern have discovered "a particle consistent with the higgs boson- but which one?" so, while this is undoubtedly a milestone with "global implications", he says, it is also the beginning of a lot more research and investigation. but, he adds, "i think we can be very, very optimistic". 9.49am: peter higgs, who first proposed the idea of this boson in 1964 and is now 83, may have shed a tear or two there- a sight which seems to have got everyone else going too. #higgs is crying... it's a great day for physics. i am proud of being a physician :?) 9.58am: peter higgs has just been asked to say a few words. "for me it's a really incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," he said, giving his congratulations to everyone involved in what he described as a "tremendous achievement". 10.16am: earlier i pointed out that four of the 10 worldwide trends on twitter were higgs-related. i erred. there were five- but one of them was comic sans. turns out that, instead of remarking on the incredible achievements of the physicists at cern, some people would prefer to ridicule them for presenting their results in a funny font. cern need a design partner - comic sans for a serious presentation of breakthrough findings! really? cern's higgs presentation just added weight to the theory that comic sans is a terrible font. 10.18am: press conference time. more layman's terms please! first question goes straight to the point: "have you found the higgs boson or not?" heuer replies that, as he said earlier, in layman's terms, they have "got it". but as a scientist i say 'what do we have?' we have a boson. now we have to discover what kind of boson it is. 10.25am: for anyone who's just joined the fun, you can watch the live stream 10.28am: all the journalists are begging for layman's terms. rolf heuer of cern is trying all kinds of inventive allegories to explain the discovery. is it working? not entirely sure. 10.31am: were they surprised by how quickly they made this discovery? after all, points out one journalist, "supersymmetry" was what they were expected to hit upon first. yes, replies heuer. gianotti agrees, attributing the speed to the "impressive performance of the accelerator" and the experiments which have worked very well. incandela says that this discovery could actually help in the search for supersymmetry. in fact, the existence of a higgs-like boson actually is a very strong motivation for the existence of supersymmetry...we're going to try and hunt it down. 10.37am: ooo, we're into rumsfeldian territory here. a spokesman says they also want to go after the unknown unknowns. 10.38am: how did the leaders of atlas and cms feel upon completing this discovery? like "walking on air", says incandela. it was a magnificent moment to see the reaction of the community. gianotti praises the "dedication, the competence, the talent" of everyone in her team, atlas. 10.45am: john ellis of cern has emailed this evaluation to the guardian's ian sample. there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter. heuer has just had another valiant effort at explaining the science in terms a small child would understand. how close is what they've found to the higgs boson, asks a journalist? it's as if, he explains, you think you see your best friend- but is it your best friend or your best friend's twin? basically: more work is needed. he concluded: 10.54am: we're asking commenters to help us explain the higgs boson. my colleague hannah waldram has passed me on these interesting contributions: muscleguy: it's like there has been a figure in black in the ballet that the other dancers can see so dance around and with but we can't see. we see the shape of the ballet but cannot, until now see all the dancers. richardacre: it's like zoologists trying to determine if they've discovered a new species of butterfly by looking at a meadow through binoculars. from 16 miles away. our very own shiv malik has also put his scientist's hat on to try to explain one talking point is how reliable the results are. this is based on how certain physicists are about the data they have. the way this is normally measured is through standard deviation i.e. the 1-5 sigma that we've been hearing about. handy explainer graphically shows what deviation is on a usual distribution graph or a bell curve, where most results are based around the middle but there are also some extreme results at either end. something like plotting height amongst a big population of 35 year old males would give you a bell curve graph like this. tall and short at either end but most people are say, 5 ft 8". five sigma from the standard deviation therefore means many steps away from the norm. in terms of height it would be say, adults males who are either 2ft or 7ft tall i.e. very unusual. but now reverse engineer the exercise. imagine you are looking at 7ft people and you want to know how likely it is that this is a strange result from the middle or the norm. how would you work this out? how would you come up with a number to represent this? well, looking at the data, plotting the graph, you could say that 7ft adult males represent 5 sigma deviation from the norm, so you are pretty sure that this is an odd or unusual result and therefore worth being (statistically speaking) interested about. this is what those at cern have been saying today. 11.00am: as the journalists in geneva continue to beg the cern guys for replies they can understand, here at the guardian we are can you help us break it down into even simpler terms? if you're a scientist, a teacher or a physics fan with a knack for explaining big ideas and small particles, we're imploring you to help. ? how would you explain higgs boson to a 7-year-old? ? what analogy best explains what's happening at cern? ? can it be described in 200 words? 11.09am: a bold reuters journalist just asked them to provide their own metaphors for the higgs boson. alas. "the podium is metaphorless," replied heuer. british physicist peter higgs (right) speaks with belgium physicist francois englert. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 11.18am: ok, that's that. the press conference is over. throughout, peter higgs refused to make any comment other than to praise the achievement and to say he was making no further comment. he obviously didn't want to hog the limelight, which will only endear him further to his new legion of twitter fans. storify of twitter jokes about the higgs boson as collated by hannah waldram. sure there are plenty more to come, so tweet your best to @guardian on #higgsjokes. 11.34am: you can now read ian sample's excellent take on this morning's announcement at length here. and, for those of who still a little in the dark, check out 11.55am: my colleagues hannah and laura have been collating some of the lovely explanations coming in in response to our plea to explain the higgs boson in a way a 7-year-old child would understand. once upon a time in a far away land, there were two rival families: fermions and bosons. fermions were famous for their peculiar half spin dance. electrons, protons and quarks were all fermions. the bosons however were into full spinning though and despised half spin. photons and gluons were bosons. it was rumored that bosons had a long lost elder brother called higgs boson who had been missing for a long long time. one day a wise old man came to the land of the feuding families. he told them they should stop quaerlling over half spin and full spin, since they all used to be the same, and that they all used to be massless. the old man said that, in the beginning of time when the universe was created, everyone was born the same, but then they were immersed in a mysterious field called the higgs field making each of them different except for photons who remained the same. he said this mysterious field was made up of the higgs boson - the long lost boson brother. the families ofcourse refused to believe all this hogwash, and so the old man set about trying to prove his story and bring the higgs boson out of his hiding place. to do this he asked for help from the scientists at cern. the family feud is coming to an end, at last. 12.03pm: the science community seems agreed: this is a big moment. but many, like heuer, are cautioning that this could be just the beginning. dr roberto trotta, lecturer in cosmology at imperial college london, has this to say, according to the science media centre. this could be just the first step towards uncovering a completely new layer of reality - the higgs might lead to the discovery of supersymmetry: the notion that for every known particle there exist a super-particle with a much larger mass. and if supersymmetry is real, then we are on our way to finally crack the mystery of the dark matter in the universe. dark matter might be 'the last highlander' of all supersymmetric particles, the only surviving 'sparticle' from the big bang. and we might be on the verge of hunting it down at the lhc. professor john womersley, stfc chief executive, said: obviously having found a new particle, there is still much, much more to do at the lhc - we need to confirm that this new particle is the reason some particles have tangible mass while others are insubstantial - as proposed by peter higgs and other scientists, who predicted that a previously unknown particle must exist for our current understanding of the universe to work. and, for professor valentin khoze, director of durham university's institute for particle physics phenomenology (ippp), this discovery is just opening the door to others that could be even more exciting. the second part of the story about the higgs particle is even more exciting as it provides us with a window to new physics - a tool for the exploration of the truly unknown. the next stage will be a detailed and careful study of its properties. successful completion of this second stage will bring us closer to uncovering new physics, explaining dark matter and other mysteries of the universe. stephen hawking bet gordy kane (umich) $100 that the higgs would never be found at cern. wonder if he's conceded defeat? 12.24pm: still full of higgs related questions? cern theorist ignatios antoniadis has had a go at answering some of the public's most pressing queries here . broken down into the main points antoniadis says: ? the newly-discovered particle looks like the higgs boson but, as its properties have not been fully studied yet, a final label will "only come after further investigations". ? the cern scientists will specifically be looking at decay rates as these, together with mass, characterise particles. the particle could either decay "with the rates expected from the standard model (sm)", or it will decay differently- which will then beg the question of whether the sm needs "small adjustments...or if new physics processes need to be looked for in order to explain its nature". (i think this would be a pretty major upset.) ? the particle, because of its low mass, has allowed the scientific community to rule out theories such as "technicolor" and "some of the theoretical models used in supersymmetry. however, other supersymmetric or not scenarios could still apply, as well as extra-dimensional theories." ? the good news for theorists is that experimentalists may be able to provide us with this information about decay rates over the next few months. 12.38pm: and if after all this you still have questions relating to the-particle-that-may-be-higgs-but-is-not-for-sure, there'll be a live q+a taking place at 1pm here. my colleague laura oliver writes: got a question about the higgs boson, cern or the large hadron collider, but been too afraid to ask? as we report live from geneva on scientists' latest efforts to find the 'god particle', two leading physics professors will be online to take your questions. from 1pm bst we will have professor stefan soldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the school of physics and astronomy, university of manchester, and professor andy parker, professor of high energy physics at the university of cambridge, available to answer your questions about the higgs boson. 12.43pm: and some more higgs trivia (i'm not sure any of it is really trivial, but anyway) courtesy of the press association. q: what is the higgs boson and the higgs field? a: the higgs field has been described as a kind of cosmic "treacle" spread through the universe. as particles travel through the treacle they slow down, lose energy and get heavier. the higgs boson is the force-carrying particle that helps transmit the effects of the higgs field. q: what would the world be like without the higgs boson? a: according to the standard model theory, it would not be recognisable. without something to give mass to the basic building blocks of matter, everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with other particles. ordinary matter, as we know it, would not exist. q: how did the higgs boson get the nickname "the god particle"? a: a nobel laureate physicist from fermilab called leon lederman wrote a book in the early 1990s about the search for the higgs boson. his publishers coined the name as a marketable title for the book, but it's disliked by many scientists. 1.27pm: my colleague mary hamilton happens to have a brother with a phd in quantum mechanics (handy, that), who has spent his lunch break emailing his thoughts on the higgs announcement and what it all means. below the line but here's his answer to the burning question: was it a standard model higgs, or something else? well, according to today's results, both detectors actually saw a bigger excess in the diphoton channel - i.e. more than would be predicted with a standard model higgs. also the tau-tau channel showed nothing at all. that could mean that this isn't a sm higgs which would be what's know in the trade as "cool new science". having said that, those discrepancies are not yet very significant ( admitted to the bbc that he's lost his bet that the higgs particle wouldn't be found (see 12.09pm ). it seems i have just lost $100. the results, said hawking, "strongly suggest" that cern had found the higgs particle. if its properties turn out to be as expected, he said, "it will be strong evidence for the so-called standard model of particle physics, the theory that explains all our experiments so far." this is an important result and should guarantee higgs the nobel prize but it is a pity in a way because the great advances in physics have come from experiments that gave results we didn't expect. been on the airwaves telling the bbc why, for him, this day is one for the history books. this is without doubt in my opinion the biggest scientific discovery of my lifetime and without doubt one of the biggest scientific discoveries of all time, so i'm tremendously excited... this day will go down as one of the great days in the history of science i think, and that's not overly hyperbolic. cox said he almost felt shocked that "such a strange thing" had been shown to be true. this is a prediction that was made almost 50 years ago. and the prediction is that the universe, everywhere, empty space, everywhere you look, every little cubic centimetre of space in front of you and inside your body and across the universe, is rammed full of higgs particles, and everything that makes up your body, the little subatomic particles in your hand, are bouncing off them, and that's how they get their mass. and more than that the theory said that these higgs particles condensed out into empty space less than a billionth of a second after the universe began. it sounds very esoteric and fundamental. but what we've shown today is that's right. that's actually how the universe works. so it's one of the central planks of our understanding of how everything in the universe works. and even though, throughout my whole career as a particle physicist of 20 years now, this theory has been there, i think the realisation that it's actually right is quite shocking, actually; i'm quite shocked that such a strange thing has been shown to be true. 2.39pm: we're going to wrap up this live blog now. thanks for all your illuminating and engaged comments; i can only apologise for my woeful inability to understand almost anything that was said by the clever people of cern. for a brilliant write-up of what today means- and, to quote him, why "the real work begins" now- have a look at ian sample's higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle 09.43 edt on wednesday 4 july 2012. it was last modified at higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle contributor open for comments. in the greatest of ironies, proof of a god particle might prove the non-existence of god. what's with the 'boffin' thing in reference to the excellent mr. (dr.? prof.?) sample? isn't the guardian normally a bit more careful with personal and professional stereotyping? of couse, i retract this comment unreservedly if he actuall yet you refer to them as god's choice ;) add that turn of phrase to the wonderfully verboten "god damn particle" and we illustrate the power of human language to skew the world. which returns us to irony! clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. when this was all starting to come to the fore a couple of years ago or whenever it was (before the machine broke down - hope it was under guarantee) it sounded exciting - they were going to be doing all this smashing up of stuff in this hi tech tunnel and i was hoping there'd be some really cool photos and videos of it all happening. i liked ian sample's video. what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? how disappointing to discover that all we're going to get is data and a probability reading of the (god?) damn thing existing. once the higgs particle is detected and experiments are repeated a few times to be sure, what then? what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? the photon is probably the most important on a day-to-day level, since exchange of photons results in the electromagnetic force, which is what prevents everything from collapsing in a heap... congratulations to the scientists. great day for them (and the rest of us). money well spent europe. none so far but the apparent mass of the higgs is consistent with ss. electrons, on the other hand, do not appear to be composite - but they might be on scales smaller than those we can currently probe. observer1951: the universe we see is made of of energetically stable (relative to the lifespan of the universe) particles. the higgs particle is hugely unstable because it's so energetic. we have to put an awful lot of energy into one place in order to produce it; then fractions of a second later, the universe notices that we've piled a lot up and it avalanches down as other, more stable particles / portions of energy. it's these particles we can see and we work backwards to deduce where they came from. so if the higgs particle is unstable, the field isn't - particles don't actually have to really exist for them to have an effect - the quantum foam (at the smallest possible distance in the universe, the planck length) is popping particles in and out all the time, they're not really there, but things don't add up unless we take them into account. the higgs boson is unstable because it is energetically favourable for it to decay to something else. the higgs field is different thing from the particle - you could say the higgs boson is the physical manifestation of the field, and there is no problem with a stable field resulting in an unstable particle. higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

C	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle what happens inside the large hadron collider. scientists at cern, near geneva, have this morning announced the likely discovery of the higgs boson particle. photograph: cern been on the airwaves telling the bbc why, for him, this day is one for the history books. this is without doubt in my opinion the biggest scientific discovery of my lifetime and without doubt one of the biggest scientific discoveries of all time, so i'm tremendously excited... this day will go down as one of the great days in the history of science i think, and that's not overly hyperbolic. cox said he almost felt shocked that "such a strange thing" had been shown to be true. this is a prediction that was made almost 50 years ago. and the prediction is that the universe, everywhere, empty space, everywhere you look, every little cubic centimetre of space in front of you and inside your body and across the universe, is rammed full of higgs particles, and everything that makes up your body, the little subatomic particles in your hand, are bouncing off them, and that's how they get their mass. and more than that the theory said that these higgs particles condensed out into empty space less than a billionth of a second after the universe began. it sounds very esoteric and fundamental. but what we've shown today is that's right. that's actually how the universe works. so it's one of the central planks of our understanding of how everything in the universe works. and even though, throughout my whole career as a particle physicist of 20 years now, this theory has been there, i think the realisation that it's actually right is quite shocking, actually; i'm quite shocked that such a strange thing has been shown to be true. admitted to the bbc that he's lost his bet that the higgs particle wouldn't be found (see 12.09pm ). it seems i have just lost $100. the results, said hawking, "strongly suggest" that cern had found the higgs particle. if its properties turn out to be as expected, he said, "it will be strong evidence for the so-called standard model of particle physics , the theory that explains all our experiments so far." this is an important result and should guarantee higgs the nobel prize but it is a pity in a way because the great advances in physics have come from experiments that gave results we didn't expect. 1.27pm: my colleague mary hamilton happens to have a brother with a phd in quantum mechanics (handy, that), who has spent his lunch break emailing his thoughts on the higgs announcement and what it all means. below the line but here's his answer to the burning question: was it a standard model higgs, or something else?

cern theorist ignatios antoniadis has had a go at answering some of the public's most pressing queries here . broken down into the main points antoniadis says: ? the newly-discovered particle looks like the higgs boson but, as its properties have not been fully studied yet, a final label will "only come after further investigations". ? the cern scientists will specifically be looking at decay rates as these, together with mass, characterise particles. the particle could either decay "with the rates expected from the standard model (sm)", or it will decay differently- which will then beg the question of whether the sm needs "small adjustments...or if new physics processes need to be looked for in order to explain its nature". (i think this would be a pretty major upset.) ? the particle, because of its low mass, has allowed the scientific community to rule out theories such as "technicolor" and "some of the theoretical models used in supersymmetry. however, other supersymmetric or not scenarios could still apply, as well as extra-dimensional theories." ? the good news for theorists is that experimentalists may be able to provide us with this information about decay rates over the next few months. stephen hawking bet gordy kane (umich) $100 that the higgs would never be found at cern. wonder if he's conceded defeat? 12.03pm: the science community seems agreed: this is a big moment. but many, like heuer, are cautioning that this could be just the beginning. dr roberto trotta, lecturer in cosmology at imperial college london, has this to say, according to the science media centre. this could be just the first step towards uncovering a completely new layer of reality - the higgs might lead to the discovery of supersymmetry: the notion that for every known particle there exist a super-particle with a much larger mass. and if supersymmetry is real, then we are on our way to finally crack the mystery of the dark matter in the universe. dark matter might be 'the last highlander' of all supersymmetric particles, the only surviving 'sparticle' from the big bang. and we might be on the verge of hunting it down at the lhc. professor john womersley, stfc chief executive, said: obviously having found a new particle, there is still much, much more to do at the lhc - we need to confirm that this new particle is the reason some particles have tangible mass while others are insubstantial - as proposed by peter higgs and other scientists, who predicted that a previously unknown particle must exist for our current understanding of the universe to work. and, for professor valentin khoze, director of durham university's institute for particle physics phenomenology (ippp), this discovery is just opening the door to others that could be even more exciting. the second part of the story about the higgs particle is even more exciting as it provides us with a window to new physics - a tool for the exploration of the truly unknown. the next stage will be a detailed and careful study of its properties. successful completion of this second stage will bring us closer to uncovering new physics, explaining dark matter and other mysteries of the universe. 11.55am: my colleagues hannah and laura have been collating some of the lovely explanations coming in in response to our plea to explain the higgs boson in a way a 7-year-old child would understand. once upon a time in a far away land, there were two rival families: fermions and bosons. fermions were famous for their peculiar half spin dance. electrons, protons and quarks were all fermions. the bosons however were into full spinning though and despised half spin. photons and gluons were bosons. it was rumored that bosons had a long lost elder brother called higgs boson who had been missing for a long long time. one day a wise old man came to the land of the feuding families. he told them they should stop quaerlling over half spin and full spin, since they all used to be the same, and that they all used to be massless. the old man said that, in the beginning of time when the universe was created, everyone was born the same, but then they were immersed in a mysterious field called the higgs field making each of them different except for photons who remained the same. he said this mysterious field was made up of the higgs boson - the long lost boson brother. the families ofcourse refused to believe all this hogwash, and so the old man set about trying to prove his story and bring the higgs boson out of his hiding place. to do this he asked for help from the scientists at cern. the family feud is coming to an end, at last. 11.34am: you can now read ian sample's excellent take on this morning's announcement at length here. and, for those of who still a little in the dark, check out storify of twitter jokes about the higgs boson as collated by hannah waldram. sure there are plenty more to come, so tweet your best to @guardian on #higgsjokes. british physicist peter higgs (right) speaks with belgium physicist francois englert. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 11.18am: ok, that's that. the press conference is over. throughout, peter higgs refused to make any comment other than to praise the achievement and to say he was making no further comment. he obviously didn't want to hog the limelight, which will only endear him further to his new legion of twitter fans. 11.09am: a bold reuters journalist just asked them to provide their own metaphors for the higgs boson. alas. "the podium is metaphorless," replied heuer. 11.00am: as the journalists in geneva continue to beg the cern guys for replies they can understand, here at the guardian we are can you help us break it down into even simpler terms? if you're a scientist, a teacher or a physics fan with a knack for explaining big ideas and small particles, we're imploring you to help. ? how would you explain higgs boson to a 7-year-old? ? what analogy best explains what's happening at cern? ? can it be described in 200 words? 10.54am: we're asking commenters to help us explain the higgs boson. my colleague hannah waldram has passed me on these interesting contributions: muscleguy: it's like there has been a figure in black in the ballet that the other dancers can see so dance around and with but we can't see. we see the shape of the ballet but cannot, until now see all the dancers. richardacre: it's like zoologists trying to determine if they've discovered a new species of butterfly by looking at a meadow through binoculars. from 16 miles away. our very own shiv malik has also put his scientist's hat on to try to explain one talking point is how reliable the results are. this is based on how certain physicists are about the data they have. the way this is normally measured is through standard deviation i.e. the 1-5 sigma that we've been hearing about. handy explainer graphically shows what deviation is on a usual distribution graph or a bell curve, where most results are based around the middle but there are also some extreme results at either end. something like plotting height amongst a big population of 35 year old males would give you a bell curve graph like this. tall and short at either end but most people are say, 5 ft 8". five sigma from the standard deviation therefore means many steps away from the norm. in terms of height it would be say, adults males who are either 2ft or 7ft tall i.e. very unusual. but now reverse engineer the exercise. imagine you are looking at 7ft people and you want to know how likely it is that this is a strange result from the middle or the norm. how would you work this out? how would you come up with a number to represent this? well, looking at the data, plotting the graph, you could say that 7ft adult males represent 5 sigma deviation from the norm, so you are pretty sure that this is an odd or unusual result and therefore worth being (statistically speaking) interested about. this is what those at cern have been saying today. 10.45am: john ellis of cern has emailed this evaluation to the guardian's ian sample. there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter. heuer has just had another valiant effort at explaining the science in terms a small child would understand. how close is what they've found to the higgs boson, asks a journalist? it's as if, he explains, you think you see your best friend- but is it your best friend or your best friend's twin? basically: more work is needed. he concluded: 10.38am: how did the leaders of atlas and cms feel upon completing this discovery? like "walking on air", says incandela. it was a magnificent moment to see the reaction of the community. gianotti praises the "dedication, the competence, the talent" of everyone in her team, atlas. 10.37am: ooo, we're into rumsfeldian territory here. a spokesman says they also want to go after the unknown unknowns. 10.31am: were they surprised by how quickly they made this discovery? after all, points out one journalist, "supersymmetry" was what they were expected to hit upon first. yes, replies heuer. gianotti agrees, attributing the speed to the "impressive performance of the accelerator" and the experiments which have worked very well. incandela says that this discovery could actually help in the search for supersymmetry. in fact, the existence of a higgs-like boson actually is a very strong motivation for the existence of supersymmetry...we're going to try and hunt it down. 10.28am: all the journalists are begging for layman's terms. rolf heuer of cern is trying all kinds of inventive allegories to explain the discovery. is it working? not entirely sure. 10.25am: for anyone who's just joined the fun, you can watch the live stream 10.18am: press conference time. more layman's terms please! first question goes straight to the point: "have you found the higgs boson or not?" heuer replies that, as he said earlier, in layman's terms, they have "got it". but as a scientist i say 'what do we have?' we have a boson. now we have to discover what kind of boson it is. 10.16am: earlier i pointed out that four of the 10 worldwide trends on twitter were higgs-related. i erred. there were five- but one of them was comic sans. turns out that, instead of remarking on the incredible achievements of the physicists at cern, some people would prefer to ridicule them for presenting their results in a funny font. cern need a design partner - comic sans for a serious presentation of breakthrough findings! really? cern's higgs presentation just added weight to the theory that comic sans is a terrible font. 9.58am: peter higgs has just been asked to say a few words. "for me it's a really incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," he said, giving his congratulations to everyone involved in what he described as a "tremendous achievement". 9.49am: peter higgs, who first proposed the idea of this boson in 1964 and is now 83, may have shed a tear or two there- a sight which seems to have got everyone else going too. #higgs is crying... it's a great day for physics. i am proud of being a physician :?) 9.46am: heuer flashes up on screen a slide that says cern have discovered "a particle consistent with the higgs boson- but which one?" so, while this is undoubtedly a milestone with "global implications", he says, it is also the beginning of a lot more research and investigation. but, he adds, "i think we can be very, very optimistic". 9.44am: rolf heuer, director general of cern, offers this verdict: as a layman i would say: i think we have it. you agree? the audience claps. i think that's a yes. 9.41am: some physicists are being more certain about interpreting these results than others. for professor stefan s?ldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the university of manchester, "there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists". today we have witnessed a discovery which gives unique insight into our understanding of the universe and the origin of the masses of fundamental particles. there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists and we now have to understand its properties and whether it behaves exactly as predicted by theory. this discovery is the first milestone of the lhc physics programme and opens the door to many more exciting discoveries by the lhc experiments in the next decade. a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by cern. photograph: afp/getty images atlas - round of applause + cheers. 5 sigma discovery at 126.5 gev standard model expectation would be 4.6 sigma, so compatible with sm prediction july 4, 2012 "i'm not done yet; there's more to come!" she laughs. she has these guys in the palm of her hand. 9.32am: today's discovery is "unbelievably exciting", according to harvard physicist lisa randall. i really didn't expect this. they got enough data and improved analysis to the point where we know about a new particle months before i expected (based on asking lots of people)! it is unbelievably exciting. , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern, had this evaluation for ian over in geneva: is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion. 9.29am: "#cern" is trending worldwide. as is #higgs, and #godparticle (sorry), and atlas. no #higgsteria yet though, despite a valiant effort by social media types. participants applaud after the presentation of the atlas experiments. photograph: denis balibouse/ap 9.23am: gianotti is still presenting atlas's results but the reaction is already pouring in. here's are the first few paragraphs from there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , home of the large hadron collider near geneva, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. 9.21am: first reaction from peter higgs has just landed in my inbox. according to a statement sent by edinburgh university, the physicist says he is "astounded" at the speed with which the results have emerged and is preparing to celebrate. scientists at cern are to be congratulated on today's results, which are a great achievement for the large hadron collider and other experiments leading up to this. i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge. 9.14am: "both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev," confirms a press release from cern. this release as saying: we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage, but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication. the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks. and sergio bertolucci, research director of cern, says: it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data. the results presented today are labelled preliminary, the statement adds. they are based on data collected in 2011 and 2012, with the 2012 data still under analysis. publication of the analyses shown today is expected around the end of july. a more complete picture of today's observations will emerge later this year after the lhc provides the experiments with more data. the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe. are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient in the standard model of particle physics? or is it something more exotic? the standard model describes the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them. all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about 4% of the total. a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96% of the universe that remains obscure. positive identification of the new particle's characteristics will take considerable time and data. but whatever form the higgs particle takes, our knowledge of the fundamental structure of matter is about to take a major step forward. 9.09am: the new scientist, reporting from the auditorium, says cern has pre-empted gianotti. and the results from atlas also look exciting. 9.05am: ap's take on incandela's presentation. one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom smasher says it has found strong evidence of a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. joe incandela, leader of one of the teams, told scientists at the european center for nuclear research, or cern, that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, popularly referred to as the "god particle." brian cox. in simple language, cms have discovered a new boson, and it behaves like the standard model higgs 8.55am: up now is fabiola giannotti, leader of the 3,000-strong group that works on the collider's five-storey atlas detector. a little piece about her and her work at the lhc last year. the appointment put her in the top ranks of a profession dominated by men. she came to physics from an education steeped in ancient greek, philosophy and the history of art - she had also trained as a pianist at the milan conservatory. but she ultimately chose physics to answer the big question of why things are as they are. "physics is, unfortunately, often seen as a male subject; sterile and without charm or emotion," she told the cern magazine. "but this is not true, because physics is art, aesthetics, beauty and symmetry." his reflection from incandela's presentation is: huge question ongoing: are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new? easiest way to make different channels mismatch is to add new particles to your theory that couple to the higgs, and enter as virtual particles that modify different decay rates. full employment for both experimentalists and theorists! 8.48am: incandela has finished. there's warm applause. his summary: all channels combined, sensitivity is 4.9 sigma. all results are consistent. we have observed a new boson with a mass of 125.3 plus or minus 0.6 gev at 4.9 sigma standard deviation-incandela. applause!!! 8.43am: more interpretative tweets courtesy of those who can interpret these results. and combined - 5 sigma. round of applause. that's a discovery of a higgs - like particle at cms. they thank lhc for the data! 5 sigma is the usual particle physics threshold for discovery. it roughly means that you're 99.9999% sure scientists at the cern research centre have discovered a new subatomic particle that could be the elusive higgs boson, which is believed to be crucial in the formation of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of the uk's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." 8.24am: reuters has just posted a flash update that claims cern scientists have discovered a new sub-atomic particle that could be the higgs boson. 8.21am: i'm not going to lie: this is a little above my gcse physics. 8.13am: as incandela speaks, the brilliant ian sample is live-tweeting from cern. july 4, 2012 and we're keeping our observations extremely serious in keeping with the potentially historic nature of the day. 8.02am: and we're off. first up is joe incandela, the leader of the team using the cms detector to search for new particles. he'll be followed by fabiola gianotti from the other team using the atlas detector. he says the results are "very strong, very solid". british physicist peter higgs (right) arrives at the seminar. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 7.52am: clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. now, the anticipation mounts. 7.38am: now, two video links for your viewing pleasure. and here is a video from the guardian's own resident boffin, science correspondent ian sample. heroically, he attempts to explain the higgs boson by means of a tray from our canteen and some coloured ping pong balls. 7.17am: good morning all. two teams of physicists at the cern laboratory near geneva are preparing today to announce their latest efforts to discover the higgs boson. participants take a rest early before the opening of the seminar. photograph: denis balibouse/afp/getty images the elusive "god particle" has become the most sought-after particle in modern science. its discovery would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space, and excitement in the scientific community is at fever pitch. peter higgs, the edinburgh university physicist who proposed the idea of the particle in 1964, is flying in to geneva, as are two other men who published similar theories at around the same time: fran?ois englert, professor emeritus at the free university of brussels (ulb) in belgium, and tom kibble, professor emeritus at imperial college london. there have been rumours, speculation, and, last night, even an apparent leak from the laboratory when a higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle 09.00 edt on wednesday 4 july 2012. it was first published at higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle higgs boson: us physicists find strongest evidence yet of 'god particle' why the higgs particle hunt was always going to be a waiting game strong hints of the higgs boson from tevatron particle collider in us contributor open for comments. in the greatest of ironies, proof of a god particle might prove the non-existence of god. what's with the 'boffin' thing in reference to the excellent mr. (dr.? prof.?) sample? isn't the guardian normally a bit more careful with personal and professional stereotyping? of couse, i retract this comment unreservedly if he actuall yet you refer to them as god's choice ;) add that turn of phrase to the wonderfully verboten "god damn particle" and we illustrate the power of human language to skew the world. which returns us to irony! clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. when this was all starting to come to the fore a couple of years ago or whenever it was (before the machine broke down - hope it was under guarantee) it sounded exciting - they were going to be doing all this smashing up of stuff in this hi tech tunnel and i was hoping there'd be some really cool photos and videos of it all happening. i liked ian sample's video. what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? how disappointing to discover that all we're going to get is data and a probability reading of the (god?) damn thing existing. once the higgs particle is detected and experiments are repeated a few times to be sure, what then? what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? the photon is probably the most important on a day-to-day level, since exchange of photons results in the electromagnetic force, which is what prevents everything from collapsing in a heap... congratulations to the scientists. great day for them (and the rest of us). money well spent europe. none so far but the apparent mass of the higgs is consistent with ss. electrons, on the other hand, do not appear to be composite - but they might be on scales smaller than those we can currently probe. observer1951: the universe we see is made of of energetically stable (relative to the lifespan of the universe) particles. the higgs particle is hugely unstable because it's so energetic. we have to put an awful lot of energy into one place in order to produce it; then fractions of a second later, the universe notices that we've piled a lot up and it avalanches down as other, more stable particles / portions of energy. it's these particles we can see and we work backwards to deduce where they came from. so if the higgs particle is unstable, the field isn't - particles don't actually have to really exist for them to have an effect - the quantum foam (at the smallest possible distance in the universe, the planck length) is popping particles in and out all the time, they're not really there, but things don't add up unless we take them into account. the higgs boson is unstable because it is energetically favourable for it to decay to something else. the higgs field is different thing from the particle - you could say the higgs boson is the physical manifestation of the field, and there is no problem with a stable field resulting in an unstable particle. higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

T	geneva: eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle | health & science | centredaily.com
C	bill takes aim at sandusky's pension, legislation would end state payments to sex offenders by john heilprin - associated press geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries."

C	'we've observed a new particle': cern announces that it has found higgs boson scientists 'will say they are 99.99% certain' the particle has been found leading physicists have been invited to event - sparking speculation that higgs boson particle has been found 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass could be end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle by rob waugh published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 02:28 est, 4 july 2012 comments ( 0 ) share the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that lends mass to matter and holds the universe together - could soon be over. cern scientists have observed a particle that matches their expectations of the higgs boson. hundreds of scientists have filed into a conference room at cern in switzerland to hear an announcement on the particle collider's progress. a leaked video reportedly from cern showed lab spokesman joe incandela saying 'we've observed a new particle ... we have quite strong evidence that there's something there.' scroll down for live video the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle invite: peter higgs, the professor the particle is named after, has been asked to attend the press conference at cern 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years.' almost, but not quite. the process of proving the higgs is real is a gradual one - and the standards for an official 'scientific discovery' are extremely high. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' would be the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. in this case, the chances of a mistake are one in a million. today the scientists at cern, the european organisation for nuclear research in geneva, are likely to announce a significant step further towards the five sigma goal. possibly, they might even be at 'four sigma', a hair's-breadth away from having the higgs in their grasp. in that case the final 'discovery' of the higgs particle will be virtually a foregone conclusion. cern's director for research and computing, sergio bertolucci, said: 'we now have more than double the data we had last year. that should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the 2011 data are still there, or whether they have gone away. it's a very exciting time.' american accelerator also finds evidence for higgs boson physicists at a u.s. laboratory say are also close to proving the existence of the higgs boson. the announcement by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago came two days before physicists at cern are set to unveil their own findings in the higgs hunt. the fermilab scientists found hints of the higgs in the debris from trillions of collisions between beams of protons and anti-protons over 10 years at the lab's now-shuttered tevatron accelerator. but the evidence still fell short of the scientific threshold for proof of the discovery of the particle, they said, in that the same collision debris hinting at the existence of the higgs could also come from other subatomic particles. 'this is the best answer that is out there at the moment,' said physicist rob roser of fermilab, which is run by the u.s. department of energy. 'the tevatron data strongly point toward the existence of the higgs boson, but it will take results from the experiments at the large hadron collider in europe to establish a firm discovery.' physicists not connected to fermilab expressed cautious optimism that the long-sought particle had finally been found. 'these intriguing hints from the tevatron appear to support the results from the lhc shown at cern in december,' said dan tovey, professor of particle physics at the university of sheffield in britain. 'the results are particularly important because they use a completely different and complementary way of searching for the higgs boson. this gives us more confidence that what we are seeing is really evidence of new physics rather than just a statistical fluke,' tovey added. tovey said scientists will have to wait until wednesday for the latest results from the european scientists before 'getting the full picture' concerning the higgs boson. inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. by following the decay patterns, scientists hope to see the 'fingerprint' of the higgs boson. physicists need the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.'

T	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle what happens inside the large hadron collider. scientists at cern, near geneva, have this morning announced the likely discovery of the higgs boson particle. photograph: cern 7.17am: good morning all. two teams of physicists at the cern laboratory near geneva are preparing today to announce their latest efforts to discover the participants take a rest early before the opening of the seminar. photograph: denis balibouse/afp/getty images the elusive "god particle" has become the most sought-after particle in modern science. its discovery would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space, and excitement in the scientific community is at fever pitch. peter higgs, the edinburgh university physicist who proposed the idea of the particle in 1964, is flying in to geneva, as are two other men who published similar theories at around the same time: fran?ois englert, professor emeritus at the free university of brussels (ulb) in belgium, and tom kibble, professor emeritus at imperial college london. there have been rumours, speculation, and, last night, even an apparent leak from the laboratory when a the guardian's ian sample has flown to geneva and i'll be live-blogging this potentially historic morning on this page. 7.38am: now, two video links for your viewing pleasure. and here is a video from the guardian's own resident boffin, science correspondent ian sample. heroically, he attempts to explain the higgs boson by means of a tray from our canteen and some coloured ping pong balls. british physicist peter higgs (right) arrives at the seminar. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 7.52am: clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. now, the anticipation mounts. 8.02am: and we're off. first up is joe incandela, the leader of the team using the cms detector to search for new particles. he'll be followed by fabiola gianotti from the other team using the atlas detector. he says the results are "very strong, very solid". 8.13am: as incandela speaks, the brilliant ian sample is live-tweeting from cern. july 4, 2012 and we're keeping our observations extremely serious in keeping with the potentially historic nature of the day. 8.21am: i'm not going to lie: this is a little above my gcse 8.24am: reuters has just posted a flash update that claims cern scientists have discovered a new sub-atomic particle that could be the higgs boson. scientists at the cern research centre have discovered a new subatomic particle that could be the elusive higgs boson, which is believed to be crucial in the formation of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of the uk's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." incandela: says when they combine the results for two decay channels they get five sigma for the 8.43am: more interpretative tweets courtesy of those who can interpret these results. and combined - 5 sigma. round of applause. that's a discovery of a higgs - like particle at cms. they thank lhc for the data! particle physics threshold for discovery. it roughly means that you're 99.9999% sure 8.48am: incandela has finished. there's warm applause. his summary: all channels combined, sensitivity is 4.9 sigma. all results are consistent. his reflection from incandela's presentation is: huge question ongoing: are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new? easiest way to make different channels mismatch is to add new particles to your theory that couple to the higgs, and enter as virtual particles that modify different decay rates. full employment for both experimentalists and theorists! 8.55am: up now is fabiola giannotti, leader of the 3,000-strong group that works on the collider's five-storey atlas detector. a little piece about her and her work at the lhc last year. the appointment put her in the top ranks of a profession dominated by men. she came to physics from an education steeped in ancient greek, philosophy and the history of art - she had also trained as a pianist at the milan conservatory. but she ultimately chose physics to answer the big question of why things are as they are. "physics is, unfortunately, often seen as a male subject; sterile and without charm or emotion," she told the cern magazine. "but this is not true, because physics is art, aesthetics, beauty and symmetry." brian cox. in simple language, cms have discovered a new boson, and it behaves like the standard model higgs 9.05am: ap's take on incandela's presentation. one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom smasher says it has found strong evidence of a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. joe incandela, leader of one of the teams, told scientists at the european center for nuclear research, or cern, that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, popularly referred to as the "god particle." 9.09am: the new scientist, reporting from the auditorium, says cern has pre-empted gianotti. and the results from atlas also look exciting. 9.14am: "both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev," confirms a press release from cern. this release as saying: we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage, but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication. the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks. and sergio bertolucci, research director of cern, says: it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data. the results presented today are labelled preliminary, the statement adds. they are based on data collected in 2011 and 2012, with the 2012 data still under analysis. publication of the analyses shown today is expected around the end of july. a more complete picture of today's observations will emerge later this year after the lhc provides the experiments with more data. the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe. are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient in the standard model of particle physics? or is it something more exotic? the standard model describes the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them. all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about 4% of the total. a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96% of the universe that remains obscure. positive identification of the new particle's characteristics will take considerable time and data. but whatever form the higgs particle takes, our knowledge of the fundamental structure of matter is about to take a major step forward. 9.21am: first reaction from peter higgs has just landed in my inbox. according to a statement sent by edinburgh university, the physicist says he is "astounded" at the speed with which the results have emerged and is preparing to celebrate. scientists at cern are to be congratulated on today's results, which are a great achievement for the large hadron collider and other experiments leading up to this. i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge. participants applaud after the presentation of the atlas experiments. photograph: denis balibouse/ap 9.23am: gianotti is still presenting atlas's results but the reaction is already pouring in. here's are the first few paragraphs from there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , home of the large hadron collider near geneva, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. 9.29am: "#cern" is trending worldwide. as is #higgs, and #godparticle (sorry), and atlas. no #higgsteria yet though, despite a valiant effort by social media types. 9.32am: today's discovery is "unbelievably exciting", according to harvard physicist lisa randall. i really didn't expect this. they got enough data and improved analysis to the point where we know about a new particle months before i expected (based on asking lots of people)! it is unbelievably exciting. , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern, had this evaluation for ian over in geneva: is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion. a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by cern. photograph: afp/getty images atlas - round of applause + cheers. 5 sigma discovery at 126.5 gev standard model expectation would be 4.6 sigma, so compatible with sm prediction july 4, 2012 "i'm not done yet; there's more to come!" she laughs. she has these guys in the palm of her hand. 9.41am: some physicists are being more certain about interpreting these results than others. for professor stefan s?ldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the university of manchester, "there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists". today we have witnessed a discovery which gives unique insight into our understanding of the universe and the origin of the masses of fundamental particles. there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists and we now have to understand its properties and whether it behaves exactly as predicted by theory. this discovery is the first milestone of the lhc physics programme and opens the door to many more exciting discoveries by the lhc experiments in the next decade. 9.44am: rolf heuer, director general of cern, offers this verdict: as a layman i would say: i think we have it. you agree? the audience claps. i think that's a yes. 9.46am: heuer flashes up on screen a slide that says cern have discovered "a particle consistent with the higgs boson- but which one?" so, while this is undoubtedly a milestone with "global implications", he says, it is also the beginning of a lot more research and investigation. but, he adds, "i think we can be very, very optimistic". 9.49am: peter higgs, who first proposed the idea of this boson in 1964 and is now 83, may have shed a tear or two there- a sight which seems to have got everyone else going too. #higgs is crying... it's a great day for physics. i am proud of being a physician :?) 9.58am: peter higgs has just been asked to say a few words. "for me it's a really incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," he said, giving his congratulations to everyone involved in what he described as a "tremendous achievement". 10.16am: earlier i pointed out that four of the 10 worldwide trends on twitter were higgs-related. i erred. there were five- but one of them was comic sans. turns out that, instead of remarking on the incredible achievements of the physicists at cern, some people would prefer to ridicule them for presenting their results in a funny font. cern need a design partner - comic sans for a serious presentation of breakthrough findings! really? cern's higgs presentation just added weight to the theory that comic sans is a terrible font. 10.18am: press conference time. more layman's terms please! first question goes straight to the point: "have you found the higgs boson or not?" heuer replies that, as he said earlier, in layman's terms, they have "got it". but as a scientist i say 'what do we have?' we have a boson. now we have to discover what kind of boson it is. 10.25am: for anyone who's just joined the fun, you can watch the live stream 10.28am: all the journalists are begging for layman's terms. rolf heuer of cern is trying all kinds of inventive allegories to explain the discovery. is it working? not entirely sure. 10.31am: were they surprised by how quickly they made this discovery? after all, points out one journalist, "supersymmetry" was what they were expected to hit upon first. yes, replies heuer. gianotti agrees, attributing the speed to the "impressive performance of the accelerator" and the experiments which have worked very well. incandela says that this discovery could actually help in the search for supersymmetry. in fact, the existence of a higgs-like boson actually is a very strong motivation for the existence of supersymmetry...we're going to try and hunt it down. 10.37am: ooo, we're into rumsfeldian territory here. a spokesman says they also want to go after the unknown unknowns. 10.38am: how did the leaders of atlas and cms feel upon completing this discovery? like "walking on air", says incandela. it was a magnificent moment to see the reaction of the community. gianotti praises the "dedication, the competence, the talent" of everyone in her team, atlas. 10.45am: john ellis of cern has emailed this evaluation to the guardian's ian sample. there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter. heuer has just had another valiant effort at explaining the science in terms a small child would understand. how close is what they've found to the higgs boson, asks a journalist? it's as if, he explains, you think you see your best friend- but is it your best friend or your best friend's twin? basically: more work is needed. he concluded: 10.54am: we're asking commenters to help us explain the higgs boson. my colleague hannah waldram has passed me on these interesting contributions: muscleguy: it's like there has been a figure in black in the ballet that the other dancers can see so dance around and with but we can't see. we see the shape of the ballet but cannot, until now see all the dancers. richardacre: it's like zoologists trying to determine if they've discovered a new species of butterfly by looking at a meadow through binoculars. from 16 miles away. our very own shiv malik has also put his scientist's hat on to try to explain one talking point is how reliable the results are. this is based on how certain physicists are about the data they have. the way this is normally measured is through standard deviation i.e. the 1-5 sigma that we've been hearing about. handy explainer graphically shows what deviation is on a usual distribution graph or a bell curve, where most results are based around the middle but there are also some extreme results at either end. something like plotting height amongst a big population of 35 year old males would give you a bell curve graph like this. tall and short at either end but most people are say, 5 ft 8". five sigma from the standard deviation therefore means many steps away from the norm. in terms of height it would be say, adults males who are either 2ft or 7ft tall i.e. very unusual. but now reverse engineer the exercise. imagine you are looking at 7ft people and you want to know how likely it is that this is a strange result from the middle or the norm. how would you work this out? how would you come up with a number to represent this? well, looking at the data, plotting the graph, you could say that 7ft adult males represent 5 sigma deviation from the norm, so you are pretty sure that this is an odd or unusual result and therefore worth being (statistically speaking) interested about. this is what those at cern have been saying today. 11.00am: as the journalists in geneva continue to beg the cern guys for replies they can understand, here at the guardian we are can you help us break it down into even simpler terms? if you're a scientist, a teacher or a physics fan with a knack for explaining big ideas and small particles, we're imploring you to help. ? how would you explain higgs boson to a 7-year-old? ? what analogy best explains what's happening at cern? ? can it be described in 200 words? 11.09am: a bold reuters journalist just asked them to provide their own metaphors for the higgs boson. alas. "the podium is metaphorless," replied heuer. british physicist peter higgs (right) speaks with belgium physicist francois englert. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 11.18am: ok, that's that. the press conference is over. throughout, peter higgs refused to make any comment other than to praise the achievement and to say he was making no further comment. he obviously didn't want to hog the limelight, which will only endear him further to his new legion of twitter fans. storify of twitter jokes about the higgs boson as collated by hannah waldram. sure there are plenty more to come, so tweet your best to @guardian on #higgsjokes. 11.34am: you can now read ian sample's excellent take on this morning's announcement at length here. and, for those of who still a little in the dark, check out 11.55am: my colleagues hannah and laura have been collating some of the lovely explanations coming in in response to our plea to explain the higgs boson in a way a 7-year-old child would understand. once upon a time in a far away land, there were two rival families: fermions and bosons. fermions were famous for their peculiar half spin dance. electrons, protons and quarks were all fermions. the bosons however were into full spinning though and despised half spin. photons and gluons were bosons. it was rumored that bosons had a long lost elder brother called higgs boson who had been missing for a long long time. one day a wise old man came to the land of the feuding families. he told them they should stop quaerlling over half spin and full spin, since they all used to be the same, and that they all used to be massless. the old man said that, in the beginning of time when the universe was created, everyone was born the same, but then they were immersed in a mysterious field called the higgs field making each of them different except for photons who remained the same. he said this mysterious field was made up of the higgs boson - the long lost boson brother. the families ofcourse refused to believe all this hogwash, and so the old man set about trying to prove his story and bring the higgs boson out of his hiding place. to do this he asked for help from the scientists at cern. the family feud is coming to an end, at last. 12.03pm: the science community seems agreed: this is a big moment. but many, like heuer, are cautioning that this could be just the beginning. dr roberto trotta, lecturer in cosmology at imperial college london, has this to say, according to the science media centre. this could be just the first step towards uncovering a completely new layer of reality - the higgs might lead to the discovery of supersymmetry: the notion that for every known particle there exist a super-particle with a much larger mass. and if supersymmetry is real, then we are on our way to finally crack the mystery of the dark matter in the universe. dark matter might be 'the last highlander' of all supersymmetric particles, the only surviving 'sparticle' from the big bang. and we might be on the verge of hunting it down at the lhc. professor john womersley, stfc chief executive, said: obviously having found a new particle, there is still much, much more to do at the lhc - we need to confirm that this new particle is the reason some particles have tangible mass while others are insubstantial - as proposed by peter higgs and other scientists, who predicted that a previously unknown particle must exist for our current understanding of the universe to work. and, for professor valentin khoze, director of durham university's institute for particle physics phenomenology (ippp), this discovery is just opening the door to others that could be even more exciting. the second part of the story about the higgs particle is even more exciting as it provides us with a window to new physics - a tool for the exploration of the truly unknown. the next stage will be a detailed and careful study of its properties. successful completion of this second stage will bring us closer to uncovering new physics, explaining dark matter and other mysteries of the universe. stephen hawking bet gordy kane (umich) $100 that the higgs would never be found at cern. wonder if he's conceded defeat? 12.24pm: still full of higgs related questions? cern theorist ignatios antoniadis has had a go at answering some of the public's most pressing queries here . broken down into the main points antoniadis says: ? the newly-discovered particle looks like the higgs boson but, as its properties have not been fully studied yet, a final label will "only come after further investigations". ? the cern scientists will specifically be looking at decay rates as these, together with mass, characterise particles. the particle could either decay "with the rates expected from the standard model (sm)", or it will decay differently- which will then beg the question of whether the sm needs "small adjustments...or if new physics processes need to be looked for in order to explain its nature". (i think this would be a pretty major upset.) ? the particle, because of its low mass, has allowed the scientific community to rule out theories such as "technicolor" and "some of the theoretical models used in supersymmetry. however, other supersymmetric or not scenarios could still apply, as well as extra-dimensional theories." ? the good news for theorists is that experimentalists may be able to provide us with this information about decay rates over the next few months. 12.38pm: and if after all this you still have questions relating to the-particle-that-may-be-higgs-but-is-not-for-sure, there'll be a live q+a taking place at 1pm here. my colleague laura oliver writes: got a question about the higgs boson, cern or the large hadron collider, but been too afraid to ask? as we report live from geneva on scientists' latest efforts to find the 'god particle', two leading physics professors will be online to take your questions. from 1pm bst we will have professor stefan soldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the school of physics and astronomy, university of manchester, and professor andy parker, professor of high energy physics at the university of cambridge, available to answer your questions about the higgs boson. 12.43pm: and some more higgs trivia (i'm not sure any of it is really trivial, but anyway) courtesy of the press association. q: what is the higgs boson and the higgs field? a: the higgs field has been described as a kind of cosmic "treacle" spread through the universe. as particles travel through the treacle they slow down, lose energy and get heavier. the higgs boson is the force-carrying particle that helps transmit the effects of the higgs field. q: what would the world be like without the higgs boson? a: according to the standard model theory, it would not be recognisable. without something to give mass to the basic building blocks of matter, everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with other particles. ordinary matter, as we know it, would not exist. q: how did the higgs boson get the nickname "the god particle"? a: a nobel laureate physicist from fermilab called leon lederman wrote a book in the early 1990s about the search for the higgs boson. his publishers coined the name as a marketable title for the book, but it's disliked by many scientists. 1.27pm: my colleague mary hamilton happens to have a brother with a phd in quantum mechanics (handy, that), who has spent his lunch break emailing his thoughts on the higgs announcement and what it all means. below the line but here's his answer to the burning question: was it a standard model higgs, or something else? well, according to today's results, both detectors actually saw a bigger excess in the diphoton channel - i.e. more than would be predicted with a standard model higgs. also the tau-tau channel showed nothing at all. that could mean that this isn't a sm higgs which would be what's know in the trade as "cool new science". having said that, those discrepancies are not yet very significant ( admitted to the bbc that he's lost his bet that the higgs particle wouldn't be found (see 12.09pm ). it seems i have just lost $100. the results, said hawking, "strongly suggest" that cern had found the higgs particle. if its properties turn out to be as expected, he said, "it will be strong evidence for the so-called standard model of particle physics, the theory that explains all our experiments so far." this is an important result and should guarantee higgs the nobel prize but it is a pity in a way because the great advances in physics have come from experiments that gave results we didn't expect. been on the airwaves telling the bbc why, for him, this day is one for the history books. this is without doubt in my opinion the biggest scientific discovery of my lifetime and without doubt one of the biggest scientific discoveries of all time, so i'm tremendously excited... this day will go down as one of the great days in the history of science i think, and that's not overly hyperbolic. cox said he almost felt shocked that "such a strange thing" had been shown to be true. this is a prediction that was made almost 50 years ago. and the prediction is that the universe, everywhere, empty space, everywhere you look, every little cubic centimetre of space in front of you and inside your body and across the universe, is rammed full of higgs particles, and everything that makes up your body, the little subatomic particles in your hand, are bouncing off them, and that's how they get their mass. and more than that the theory said that these higgs particles condensed out into empty space less than a billionth of a second after the universe began. it sounds very esoteric and fundamental. but what we've shown today is that's right. that's actually how the universe works. so it's one of the central planks of our understanding of how everything in the universe works. and even though, throughout my whole career as a particle physicist of 20 years now, this theory has been there, i think the realisation that it's actually right is quite shocking, actually; i'm quite shocked that such a strange thing has been shown to be true. 2.39pm: we're going to wrap up this live blog now. thanks for all your illuminating and engaged comments; i can only apologise for my woeful inability to understand almost anything that was said by the clever people of cern. for a brilliant write-up of what today means- and, to quote him, why "the real work begins" now- have a look at ian sample's higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle 09.43 edt on wednesday 4 july 2012. it was last modified at higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle contributor open for comments. in the greatest of ironies, proof of a god particle might prove the non-existence of god. what's with the 'boffin' thing in reference to the excellent mr. (dr.? prof.?) sample? isn't the guardian normally a bit more careful with personal and professional stereotyping? of couse, i retract this comment unreservedly if he actuall yet you refer to them as god's choice ;) add that turn of phrase to the wonderfully verboten "god damn particle" and we illustrate the power of human language to skew the world. which returns us to irony! clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. when this was all starting to come to the fore a couple of years ago or whenever it was (before the machine broke down - hope it was under guarantee) it sounded exciting - they were going to be doing all this smashing up of stuff in this hi tech tunnel and i was hoping there'd be some really cool photos and videos of it all happening. i liked ian sample's video. what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? how disappointing to discover that all we're going to get is data and a probability reading of the (god?) damn thing existing. once the higgs particle is detected and experiments are repeated a few times to be sure, what then? what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? the photon is probably the most important on a day-to-day level, since exchange of photons results in the electromagnetic force, which is what prevents everything from collapsing in a heap... congratulations to the scientists. great day for them (and the rest of us). money well spent europe. none so far but the apparent mass of the higgs is consistent with ss. electrons, on the other hand, do not appear to be composite - but they might be on scales smaller than those we can currently probe. observer1951: the universe we see is made of of energetically stable (relative to the lifespan of the universe) particles. the higgs particle is hugely unstable because it's so energetic. we have to put an awful lot of energy into one place in order to produce it; then fractions of a second later, the universe notices that we've piled a lot up and it avalanches down as other, more stable particles / portions of energy. it's these particles we can see and we work backwards to deduce where they came from. so if the higgs particle is unstable, the field isn't - particles don't actually have to really exist for them to have an effect - the quantum foam (at the smallest possible distance in the universe, the planck length) is popping particles in and out all the time, they're not really there, but things don't add up unless we take them into account. the higgs boson is unstable because it is energetically favourable for it to decay to something else. the higgs field is different thing from the particle - you could say the higgs boson is the physical manifestation of the field, and there is no problem with a stable field resulting in an unstable particle. higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

C	scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' discovery of particle is most important in physics in decades leading physicists have been invited to event at cern in switzerland discovery of particle after 40-year search audience includes professor peter higgs who suggested boson's existence 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle by rob waugh published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 02:59 est, 4 july 2012 comments ( 2 ) share the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that lends mass to matter and holds the universe together - is over. cern scientists have observed a particle that matches their expectations of the higgs boson - in an announcent to an audience of physicists including peter higgs, who first suggested the existence of the particle. professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: 'they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science.' scroll down for live video joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, announces the discovery of a particle that corresponds to theories of the higgs boson at cern today the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle a model of the large hadron collider (lhc) tunnel is seen in the cern (european organization for nuclear research) visitors' center 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' would be the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. in this case, the chances of a mistake are one in a million. cern's director for research and computing, sergio bertolucci, said: 'we now have more than double the data we had last year. that should be enough to see whether the trends we were seeing in the 2011 data are still there, or whether they have gone away. it's a very exciting time.' british physicist peter higgs (right) is welcomed by european organization for nuclear research (cern) director-general rolf-dieter heuer (left) british physicist peter higgs arrives for the conference near geneva inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider why the higgs matters - what the new particle actually means the existence of the higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the big bang, an invisible force known as the higgs field formed. this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles - or higgs bosons. as other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the higgs boson will be long term, but they could be in fields as diverse as medicine, computing and manufacturing. experts compare the search for the higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. the idea of the electron - a subatomic particle - was first floated in 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patients. at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. by following the decay patterns, scientists hope to see the 'fingerprint' of the higgs boson. physicists need the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.' cern announcement live

T	bristol university | news from the university | school of physics
C	results of 20 years' work could open a new frontier of science large hadron collider in geneva may finally have tracked down the elusive higgs boson. results announced today at cern show that a new heavy particle has been identified, with all the properties expected of the higgs. bristol physicists working at the cms experiment played a key role in establishing this exciting new result which is the culmination of twenty years' work. "if the higgs has been finally identified, this will be the biggest discovery in particle physics for forty years," said . the higgs boson is the essential connection between the mathematical theory of the universe, and the everyday world. without it, the fundamental particles which make up atoms would be massless, completely at odds with what we observe. at a deeper level, the higgs allows two of the four forces of nature to be treated as one simpler phenomenon, and completes the 'standard model' of particle physics first proposed in the 1970s. the search for the higgs requires the careful study of thousands of trillions of particle collisions at incredibly high energies. the lhc accelerates beams of protons around a 27km ring on the swiss-french border. on collision, the protons' energy is converted to new particles, which are detected by a series of huge and complex experiments. from around a billion collisions per second, a higgs boson is expected to be produced around once per minute - but only a fraction of these can be detected. physicists at the university of bristol have been working since 1993 to build and operate the cms experiment. weighing in at around 12,000 tonnes, the experiment is the size of a large building, and is packed with sensitive particle detectors which must operate around the clock. the electromagnetic calorimeter endcap detector, built by a team of physicists from bristol and other uk universities, has played a vital role in spotting the decay of the higgs boson to photons, the most important way of finding the new particle. the cms detector produces 40,000 gigabytes of information per second when operating at full speed. every byte of data is filtered, processed and then transferred along optical fibres to countries around the world, using equipment and software developed at bristol. lhc collision event at cms showing four high energy muons (cms higgs search) the identification of the new particle is the first step in the lhc research programme, and opens the door to a huge range of possibilities. physicists will now accumulate much more data in order to carefully measure the properties of the particle - only then can they positively identify it. many physicists believe that the simplest version of higgs' theory must be modified by a new phenomenon called supersymmetry. this would also provide clues as to the origin of the mysterious 'dark matter' which occupies the galaxy alongside stars and planets, and would also point the way towards deeper and simpler theories of space and time. "these new results are a huge achievement, but really represent the first step on a long road of discovery," said dr dave newbold , head of the bristol particle physics group. "the really exciting physics is all ahead of us, and it may not turn out to be what we expect." the lhc will shut down in 2013 for two years, allowing the equipment which steers and controls the proton beams to be upgraded. from 2015, the accelerator will operate with twice its current energy and three times the number of collisions, putting new discoveries within reach. work on cms is carried out in bristol alongside the study of antimatter at the cern lhcb experiment, and preparations for future facilities that will allow the higgs to be 'mass-produced' and studied in detail. what is the higgs boson? the higgs boson is a type of elementary, sub-atomic particle that is widely believed to play a key role in shaping the way the universe functions. confirming its existence is one of the main objectives of the large hadron collider (lhc), which is located at cern (the european organization for nuclear research) in switzerland. why is the higgs boson important? physicists have developed a theory called 'the standard model' to explain how the various types of elementary particle that make up the visible universe interact. with the exception of neutrino physics, results from other particle physics experiments match the standard model extremely well - but only if one missing piece, the higgs boson, is assumed to exist. based on the particles discovered to date, the standard model could not otherwise explain why some particles have mass (e.g. electrons), while others don't (e.g. photons which make up light). theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson is the key. so most physicists conclude that another elementary particle must exist - the higgs boson - and that this gives other particles their mass. in terms of our understanding of matter and the basic forces shaping the universe, this is a critical issue: without mass, there would be no matter. how does the discovery of the higgs boson compare to earlier scientific discoveries? the search for the higgs boson mirrors the discovery of the electron. the concept of the electron was first proposed in 1838 to explain the chemical properties of the atom but its presence was not confirmed by british physicist and nobel prize winner jj thompson until 1897. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. manipulating or harnessing phenomena such as electricity, magnetism and thermal conductivity rely on our understanding of the electron - applications include cathode ray tubes (television), radiotherapy treatments for cancer patients, lasers (cds, energy, manufacturing etc), microscopes, and, of course, particle accelerators like the lhc. spintronics, the technique of manipulating electron 'spin', has the potential to bring us faster computers, increased data storage and more efficient photovoltaic cells. our search for knowledge about our universe continues and it is impossible to determine where it will lead in terms of fundamental knowledge or applications. for example, we do not know why photons, the particles that make up light, have no mass. jj thompson could not have predicted where his discovery of the electron would lead, and similarly we do not know where the discovery of the higgs boson could lead. each advance opens up a new frontier of science. what does the higgs boson actually do? it's believed that higgs bosons are responsible for determining how much mass other types of elementary particle have. the theory goes as follows: countless numbers of higgs bosons make up an energy field ('the higgs field') that extends throughout the universe. when other types of elementary particle move through the higgs field, some do so very easily (like an arrow flying through the air); this results in them having little mass and, in some cases, no mass at all. but other, less 'streamlined' types of elementary particle don't move through the higgs field so easily and this results in them having a relatively high mass. where does the name 'higgs boson' come from? sub-atomic particles are divided into two categories: bosons and fermions. generally speaking, bosons are force-carrying particles while fermions are associated with matter. the higgs boson is named after professor peter higgs, a theoretical physicist at the university of edinburgh. professor higgs was one of a number of physicists who predicted the existence of what's now known as the higgs boson, which has been dubbed 'the most sought-after particle in modern physics'. a number of other researchers, including thomas kibble of imperial independently or jointly proposed a similar mechanism, but it has become generally known as the higgs mechanism. how could you 'see' a higgs boson? you can not directly see a higgs boson. it's believed that, with the right experiment in place, a decaying higgs boson would leave behind a detectable 'footprint' in the form of a unique configuration of other particles. higgs bosons should (according to current theories) be created a few times in every trillion high energy particle collisions at the lhc. what will happen if it is found? confirming the existence of the higgs boson will provide vital evidence that the standard model accurately accounts for how and why energy and matter behave as they do. it would act as a springboard to further research and an improved understanding of the universe. ultimately, it may have spin-off benefits in fields as diverse as medicine, computing, electronics and manufacturing. discovering the higgs boson would be the start of a new phase in particle physics - for example, dark matter, which forms 23 per cent of the universe is not explained in the standard model, but the properties of the higgs boson could point to which extensions of the theory are likely to be correct, setting the direction for particle physics research. conversely, the properties of the higgs boson could close off some theoretical options, so particle physics is set for a period of dramatic change if the higgs is discovered. funding the cms research programme at bristol is supported by the science & technology facilities council (stfc) the cms detector under construction in 2006 bristol researcher jim brooke constructing the electromagnetic calorimeter detector that identifies photons from decays of the higgs boson "if the higgs has been finally identified, this will be the biggest discovery in particle physics for forty years."
Q	if the higgs has been finally identified, this will be the biggest discovery in particle physics for forty years,
Q	these new results are a huge achievement, but really represent the first step on a long road of discovery,
Q	the really exciting physics is all ahead of us, and it may not turn out to be what we expect.

T	physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson - caltech media relations
C	07/04/12 physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson international consortium of scientists includes a large caltech contingent the compact muon solenoid (cms) detector at the large hadron collider (lhc). [credit: cern] pasadena, calif.-physicists at the large hadron collider (lhc) in geneva, switzerland, have discovered a new particle that may be the long-sought higgs boson, the fundamental particle that is thought to endow elementary particles with mass. "this is a momentous time in the history of particle physics and in scientific exploration-the implications are profound," says harvey newman, professor of physics at the california institute of technology (caltech). "this is experimental science at its best." the international team of scientists and engineers-which includes a large contingent from caltech, led by newman and maria spiropulu, professor of physics-says it needs more data to determine for certain if the particle they've discovered is indeed the higgs boson predicted by the standard model, the theory that describes how all particles interact. the results so far, however, show that it has many of the properties expected for such a particle. "one of the most exciting aspects of this observation is that the road remains open for a vast range of 'lookalike' alternatives, where any deviation from the standard model would point the way to the existence of other new particles or forces of nature," newman says. regardless of the exact identity of the new particle, cern's scientists say, the highly anticipated discovery heralds a new era in physics. the physicists revealed their latest results at a seminar at the european center for nuclear research (cern) in geneva, which was shared with the world with a live webcast and the evo (enabling virtual organizations) system developed at caltech. the discovery itself is based on the analysis of an unprecedented amount of data that was collected by the two main detectors at the lhc-the compact muon solenoid (cms) and a toroidal lhc apparatus (atlas). the data was collected with the lhc running at 7 teraelectron volts (tev, a unit of energy) in 2011 and 8 tev in 2012. the caltech team is part of the cms collaboration. using the cms detector, the physicists identified signals that point to a new particle with a mass of 125 gigaelectron volts (gev, a unit of mass; in comparison, the mass of a proton is about 1 gev). the team running the atlas detector, which searches for the higgs using a different method, reported similar results. "this is an incredible, exciting moment," says spiropulu. "even these early results give us important hints as to how mass in the universe came to be. together with hundreds of our colleagues caltech scientists have worked for decades to reach this point: building multiple generations of experiments; designing and building detectors to precisely measure photons, electrons, and muons, which are keys to the discovery; and inventing worldwide systems that empower thousands of physicists throughout the world to collaborate day and night, share and analyze the data, and develop the new techniques leading to this great result." to search for the higgs, physicists have had to comb through the remains of trillions of particle collisions produced by the lhc, which accelerates protons around a ring almost five miles wide to nearly the speed of light. as the protons careen toward each other, a small fraction of them collide, creating other particles such as the higgs. it is estimated that it takes one billion collisions to make just one higgs boson. the higgs is fleeting, however, and quickly decays into lighter particles, which are the traces that allow the higgs to be detected and analyzed. the higgs is predicted to decay in several different ways, or channels, each resulting in different particles. cms focuses mainly on the decay channels that result in two photons or two other particles called z bosons. it was by measuring and analyzing these and other decay particles that the physicists were able to discover the potential higgs. when all the decays are taken into account in combination, the scientists announced, the data for a signal corresponding to a standard model higgs boson have a statistical significance of five sigmas. this means the signal is highly unlikely to be the result of a statistical fluke caused by some rare, background fluctuation. only when data are significant to five sigmas are physicists confident enough to declare a discovery. last december, evidence seen in the data from cms generated plenty of excitement as a result of an excess of events-a slight surplus in particle collision events over what would have been expected if the higgs does not exist-with a statistical significance of just three sigmas. the higgs boson is the last remaining fundamental particle predicted by the standard model yet to be detected, and hopes of detecting it was one of the chief reasons for building the lhc. the lhc accelerator, along with the cms and atlas experiments, are arguably the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. despite its many successes, the standard model is incomplete-it does not incorporate gravity or dark matter, for example. one of the goals of physicists, then, is to develop more complete theories that better explain the composition of the universe and what happened during the first moments after the big bang. discovering the higgs boson-or a particle like it-is essential for developing these new theories. the measurements of the new particle, the physicists say, are so far consistent-within statistical uncertainty-with the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. still, they need more data to know for sure whether it is the predicted higgs or something stranger, a higgs lookalike-a prospect that many theorists have long been anticipating. 1200 e california blvd, mc 5-32, pasadena ca 91125 1200 e california blvd, mc 5-32, pasadena ca 91125

"even these early results give us important hints as to how mass in the universe came to be. together with hundreds of our colleagues caltech scientists have worked for decades to reach this point: building multiple generations of experiments; designing and building detectors to precisely measure photons, electrons, and muons, which are keys to the discovery; and inventing worldwide systems that empower thousands of physicists throughout the world to collaborate day and night, share and analyze the data, and develop the new techniques leading to this great result." to search for the higgs, physicists have had to comb through the remains of trillions of particle collisions produced by the lhc, which accelerates protons around a ring almost five miles wide to nearly the speed of light. as the protons careen toward each other, a small fraction of them collide, creating other particles such as the higgs. it is estimated that it takes one billion collisions to make just one higgs boson. the higgs is fleeting, however, and quickly decays into lighter particles, which are the traces that allow the higgs to be detected and analyzed. the higgs is predicted to decay in several different ways, or channels, each resulting in different particles. cms focuses mainly on the decay channels that result in two photons or two other particles called z bosons. it was by measuring and analyzing these and other decay particles that the physicists were able to discover the potential higgs. when all the decays are taken into account in combination, the scientists announced, the data for a signal corresponding to a standard model higgs boson have a statistical significance of five sigmas. this means the signal is highly unlikely to be the result of a statistical fluke caused by some rare, background fluctuation. only when data are significant to five sigmas are physicists confident enough to declare a discovery. last december, evidence seen in the data from cms generated plenty of excitement as a result of an excess of events-a slight surplus in particle collision events over what would have been expected if the higgs does not exist-with a statistical significance of just three sigmas. the higgs boson is the last remaining fundamental particle predicted by the standard model yet to be detected, and hopes of detecting it was one of the chief reasons for building the lhc. the lhc accelerator, along with the cms and atlas experiments, are arguably the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. despite its many successes, the standard model is incomplete-it does not incorporate gravity or dark matter, for example. one of the goals of physicists, then, is to develop more complete theories that better explain the composition of the universe and what happened during the first moments after the big bang. discovering the higgs boson-or a particle like it-is essential for developing these new theories. the measurements of the new particle, the physicists say, are so far consistent-within statistical uncertainty-with the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. still, they need more data to know for sure whether it is the predicted higgs or something stranger, a higgs lookalike-a prospect that many theorists have long been anticipating. 1200 e california blvd, mc 5-32, pasadena ca 91125 1200 e california blvd, mc 5-32, pasadena ca 91125

T	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind < swiss news | expatica switzerland
C	04/07/2012higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. join expatica's online community to reach out for expats just like you! switzerland's healthcare system information about the swiss healthcare system, health insurance, pharmacies and emergency numbers.

T	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened - telegraph
C	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened higgs boson: an important day for british physics 12.46pm we are wrapping up for today. thanks for joining us and please buy tomorrow's newspaper for all the latest analysis. 12.20pm prof themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, who has worked on the lhc, said: "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle. half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature. 12.10pm things became a little emotional earlier as prof higgs listened to the announcement twitter: simon pegg - was higgs boson where they left it? i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them. 11.57am comedian dara o briain explains @laurenlaverne without higgs everything would just ping around at the speed of light, not interact, and we couldn't, y'know, sit on stuff 11.46am lhc achievement is the equivalent of the discovery of dna and man landing on the moon, claims professor sir peter knight , president of the institute of physics (iop). this is the physics version of the discovery of dna. it sets the course for a brand new adventure in our efforts to understand the fabric of our universe." this is a remarkable achievement. fifteen years of international collaboration and hard work constructing the large hadron collider has paid off. akin to a moon mission, one of the most remarkable things about the hunt for the higgs is how the effort has caught the public imagination. not since the apollo missions 40 years ago has there been such a sense of popular excitement around scientific discovery. long may this continue to inspire the next generation of scientists." peter clarke , professor of physics at the university of edinburgh, provides a helpful analogy to help explain just how important the higgs boson is to the understanding of physics. asked to describe it in layman's terms, he explained: if we were discovering the human body and found a little finger on one hand, after we had already seen five fingers on the other hand, that would be important but not unexpected. it's not really adding much to what we already know. some sorts of particles can be like that - very important but predicted. this is like discovering the heart; without it the entire model of the human body does not work. that is the significance of this particle. he has also explained the higgs mechanism, using the example of trying to push a balloon (representing a massless particle) through a room while wearing a blindfold. if that room were to be filled with treacle, he explained, the balloon would feel heavy. the treacle in this instance is comparable to the higgs mechanism, permanently giving the object mass. prof clarke added he hopes the work of peter higgs work and his colleagues is considered worthy of a nobel prize. "i think many of us have believed for a long time that this work is very close to being deserving of a nobel prize. i hope it's considered worthy." 11.16am controversial question. the panel is asked how they can justify the huge budget in light of the economic crisis around the world. director general rolf heuer replies if there is no fundamental science then there is no basis for applied science. we have to strike a balance. 23 years ago the world wide web was born here. it has changed the world dramatically 11.05am ask a silly question and you get a serious answer. when a journalist asked the scientists what was the best and worst metaphor in relation to the higgs boson, they got a brusque reply from the director general twitter: nick collins - rolf-dieter heuer, dg of cern: "as a layman, i would now say i think we have it. do you agree?" huge applause. #higgs 11.02am professor higgs asked to say a few words at the press conference but he seems slightly irritated at the suggestion. i say this is not the occasion for that discussion. let us continue with the main topic 10.52am tom chivers found this... 10.44am the press association writes: scientists today hailed the "momentous" discovery of what appears to be the "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the fabric of the universe together. teams at the large hadron collider (lhc), the ?2.6 billion atom smashing machine near geneva, say they have found a new sub-atomic particle "consistent" with the higgs boson. the results are preliminary and more work is needed before the scientists can be sure of what "species" of particle they have captured. but observations carried out so far show it looks and acts like the long-sought particle that has eluded them for 50 years from the guardian asks whether the weeks have been emotional? |they have been extremely intense, full of a lot of emotions 10.38am nick collins, the daily telegraph science correspondent, asks whether peter higgs and the cern team deserve a nobel prize. director general rolf heuer replies i don't think my opinion counts but it was great work. 10.19am the press conference opens with a nice gag. cern director general rolf heuer says i think there could be worse days in the life of a director general of cern 10.15am they may know how to find a minute atomic particle but they can't use a microphone. press conference delayed by sound technical difficulties. 10.12 peter higgs has said this is "really the most incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime" twitter: nick collins - the speakers have just arrived and sat down for the press conference and had about 50 cameras shoved in their faces. rock star moment. 10.08am the announcement has been called a "momentous day for science. telegraph reporters ceri perkins , and scientists believe they have captured the elusive "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the physical fabric of the universe together. the historic announcement came in a progress report from the large hadron collider particle accelerator. professor john womersley, chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." scientists say it is a 5 sigma result which means they are 99.999% sure they have found a new particle. twitter: nick collins - "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." twitter: nick collins - standing ovation at cern. dg then turns to video link and asks for applause from ichep crowd in melbourne. #showman 10.00am speaking on bbc radio 4's today programme, scientists explained this could be be "one of the most significant steps" in human understanding of the universe and an "historic day" for physics. professor jim virdee , head of physics at imperial college, said: i suspect it's going to be a historic day. i think it will be one of the most significant steps we have taken in our understanding of how the universe works. calling it the "key missing element" in the understanding of the universe, he said: "finding the higgs boson will actually allow us to understand very deeply what's going on and open up more questions. "it's a portal from 20th century science to 21st century science." he added it could be "a great example" of a discovery that would "change they way we live". professor jon butterworth , head of astronomy and physics at ucl, said: i think it's going to be very exciting. we are really looking over the threshold in physics that we never look over before. he added a potential discovery would "give us clues to answer the other big questions." so after all last night's confusion over the large hadron collider and the higgs boson - have they found it? or have they simply made a series of home videos? - it appears that the elusive particle, or something like it, really has been found. i've been watching the live stream (see our live blog, here), and i have to admit it's several vertical kilometres above my pay grade, but here is what i've managed to glean from it. first, as was hinted yesterday, the cms detector - one of the two major experiments at the large hadron collider - has definitely found something. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the experiment, said they have seen something "very strong, very solid" at the 125gev (gigaelectronvolt) mass, where they had thought they'd seen something in december. the first slide showed a curve of results, with a single bump up at 125gev. "it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks: "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. prof peter higgs, the theorist who first predicted the existence of the higgs boson, has told the guardian that he "shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge" this evening. congratulations are due to everyone involved, it would seem. twitter: tom whipple - professor higgs: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." 9.35am "it's hard not to get excited by these results," adds cern research director sergio bertolucci professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." cern have announced that they have found a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. they are 99.999% sure it is the "god particle" 9.25am good morning on this momentous day. looks like the 50-year search for the elusive higgs boson is almost over. here's some of what we have learnt already. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the cms experiment at the large hadron collider, has announced a "very strong, very solid" finding of a new particle, at a mass of 125gev (gigaelectronvolts), where the experimenters found a hint in december. that is consistent with the predictions for the the higgs boson made by the standard model, the model of elementary physics. now a spokesman for the atlas experiment is speaking. last night, an apparently leaked video hinted that the new particle might have been found. read more in tom chivers's news story here: higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found scottish lecturer found to be 'grandfather of everyone in britain' scientists developing device to 'hack' into brain of stephen hawking higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found

"it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks: "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. prof peter higgs, the theorist who first predicted the existence of the higgs boson, has told the guardian that he "shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge" this evening. congratulations are due to everyone involved, it would seem. twitter: tom whipple - professor higgs: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." 9.35am "it's hard not to get excited by these results," adds cern research director sergio bertolucci professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." cern have announced that they have found a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. they are 99.999% sure it is the "god particle" 9.25am good morning on this momentous day. looks like the 50-year search for the elusive higgs boson is almost over. here's some of what we have learnt already. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the cms experiment at the large hadron collider, has announced a "very strong, very solid" finding of a new particle, at a mass of 125gev (gigaelectronvolts), where the experimenters found a hint in december. that is consistent with the predictions for the the higgs boson made by the standard model, the model of elementary physics. now a spokesman for the atlas experiment is speaking. last night, an apparently leaked video hinted that the new particle might have been found. read more in tom chivers's news story here: higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found scottish lecturer found to be 'grandfather of everyone in britain' scientists developing device to 'hack' into brain of stephen hawking higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found

T	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened - telegraph
C	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened higgs boson: an important day for british physics 12.46pm we are wrapping up for today. thanks for joining us and please buy tomorrow's newspaper for all the latest analysis. 12.20pm prof themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, who has worked on the lhc, said: "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle. half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature. 12.10pm things became a little emotional earlier as prof higgs listened to the announcement twitter: simon pegg - was higgs boson where they left it? i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them. 11.57am comedian dara o briain explains @laurenlaverne without higgs everything would just ping around at the speed of light, not interact, and we couldn't, y'know, sit on stuff 11.46am lhc achievement is the equivalent of the discovery of dna and man landing on the moon, claims professor sir peter knight , president of the institute of physics (iop). this is the physics version of the discovery of dna. it sets the course for a brand new adventure in our efforts to understand the fabric of our universe." this is a remarkable achievement. fifteen years of international collaboration and hard work constructing the large hadron collider has paid off. akin to a moon mission, one of the most remarkable things about the hunt for the higgs is how the effort has caught the public imagination. not since the apollo missions 40 years ago has there been such a sense of popular excitement around scientific discovery. long may this continue to inspire the next generation of scientists." peter clarke , professor of physics at the university of edinburgh, provides a helpful analogy to help explain just how important the higgs boson is to the understanding of physics. asked to describe it in layman's terms, he explained: if we were discovering the human body and found a little finger on one hand, after we had already seen five fingers on the other hand, that would be important but not unexpected. it's not really adding much to what we already know. some sorts of particles can be like that - very important but predicted. this is like discovering the heart; without it the entire model of the human body does not work. that is the significance of this particle. he has also explained the higgs mechanism, using the example of trying to push a balloon (representing a massless particle) through a room while wearing a blindfold. if that room were to be filled with treacle, he explained, the balloon would feel heavy. the treacle in this instance is comparable to the higgs mechanism, permanently giving the object mass. prof clarke added he hopes the work of peter higgs work and his colleagues is considered worthy of a nobel prize. "i think many of us have believed for a long time that this work is very close to being deserving of a nobel prize. i hope it's considered worthy." 11.16am controversial question. the panel is asked how they can justify the huge budget in light of the economic crisis around the world. director general rolf heuer replies if there is no fundamental science then there is no basis for applied science. we have to strike a balance. 23 years ago the world wide web was born here. it has changed the world dramatically 11.05am ask a silly question and you get a serious answer. when a journalist asked the scientists what was the best and worst metaphor in relation to the higgs boson, they got a brusque reply from the director general twitter: nick collins - rolf-dieter heuer, dg of cern: "as a layman, i would now say i think we have it. do you agree?" huge applause. #higgs 11.02am professor higgs asked to say a few words at the press conference but he seems slightly irritated at the suggestion. i say this is not the occasion for that discussion. let us continue with the main topic 10.52am tom chivers found this... 10.44am the press association writes: scientists today hailed the "momentous" discovery of what appears to be the "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the fabric of the universe together. teams at the large hadron collider (lhc), the ?2.6 billion atom smashing machine near geneva, say they have found a new sub-atomic particle "consistent" with the higgs boson. the results are preliminary and more work is needed before the scientists can be sure of what "species" of particle they have captured. but observations carried out so far show it looks and acts like the long-sought particle that has eluded them for 50 years from the guardian asks whether the weeks have been emotional? |they have been extremely intense, full of a lot of emotions 10.38am nick collins, the daily telegraph science correspondent, asks whether peter higgs and the cern team deserve a nobel prize. director general rolf heuer replies i don't think my opinion counts but it was great work. 10.19am the press conference opens with a nice gag. cern director general rolf heuer says i think there could be worse days in the life of a director general of cern 10.15am they may know how to find a minute atomic particle but they can't use a microphone. press conference delayed by sound technical difficulties. 10.12 peter higgs has said this is "really the most incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime" twitter: nick collins - the speakers have just arrived and sat down for the press conference and had about 50 cameras shoved in their faces. rock star moment. 10.08am the announcement has been called a "momentous day for science. telegraph reporters ceri perkins , and scientists believe they have captured the elusive "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the physical fabric of the universe together. the historic announcement came in a progress report from the large hadron collider particle accelerator. professor john womersley, chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson.

"the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." cern have announced that they have found a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. they are 99.999% sure it is the "god particle" 9.25am good morning on this momentous day. looks like the 50-year search for the elusive higgs boson is almost over. here's some of what we have learnt already. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the cms experiment at the large hadron collider, has announced a "very strong, very solid" finding of a new particle, at a mass of 125gev (gigaelectronvolts), where the experimenters found a hint in december. that is consistent with the predictions for the the higgs boson made by the standard model, the model of elementary physics. now a spokesman for the atlas experiment is speaking. last night, an apparently leaked video hinted that the new particle might have been found. read more in tom chivers's news story here: higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found scottish lecturer found to be 'grandfather of everyone in britain' scientists developing device to 'hack' into brain of stephen hawking higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found

T	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened - telegraph
C	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened higgs boson: an important day for british physics 12.46pm we are wrapping up for today. thanks for joining us and please buy tomorrow's newspaper for all the latest analysis. 12.20pm prof themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, who has worked on the lhc, said: "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle. half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature. 12.10pm things became a little emotional earlier as prof higgs listened to the announcement twitter: simon pegg - was higgs boson where they left it? i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them. 11.57am comedian dara o briain explains @laurenlaverne without higgs everything would just ping around at the speed of light, not interact, and we couldn't, y'know, sit on stuff 11.46am lhc achievement is the equivalent of the discovery of dna and man landing on the moon, claims professor sir peter knight , president of the institute of physics (iop). this is the physics version of the discovery of dna. it sets the course for a brand new adventure in our efforts to understand the fabric of our universe." this is a remarkable achievement. fifteen years of international collaboration and hard work constructing the large hadron collider has paid off. akin to a moon mission, one of the most remarkable things about the hunt for the higgs is how the effort has caught the public imagination. not since the apollo missions 40 years ago has there been such a sense of popular excitement around scientific discovery. long may this continue to inspire the next generation of scientists." peter clarke , professor of physics at the university of edinburgh, provides a helpful analogy to help explain just how important the higgs boson is to the understanding of physics. asked to describe it in layman's terms, he explained: if we were discovering the human body and found a little finger on one hand, after we had already seen five fingers on the other hand, that would be important but not unexpected. it's not really adding much to what we already know. some sorts of particles can be like that - very important but predicted. this is like discovering the heart; without it the entire model of the human body does not work. that is the significance of this particle. he has also explained the higgs mechanism, using the example of trying to push a balloon (representing a massless particle) through a room while wearing a blindfold. if that room were to be filled with treacle, he explained, the balloon would feel heavy. the treacle in this instance is comparable to the higgs mechanism, permanently giving the object mass. prof clarke added he hopes the work of peter higgs work and his colleagues is considered worthy of a nobel prize. "i think many of us have believed for a long time that this work is very close to being deserving of a nobel prize. i hope it's considered worthy." 11.16am controversial question. the panel is asked how they can justify the huge budget in light of the economic crisis around the world. director general rolf heuer replies if there is no fundamental science then there is no basis for applied science. we have to strike a balance. 23 years ago the world wide web was born here. it has changed the world dramatically 11.05am ask a silly question and you get a serious answer. when a journalist asked the scientists what was the best and worst metaphor in relation to the higgs boson, they got a brusque reply from the director general twitter: nick collins - rolf-dieter heuer, dg of cern: "as a layman, i would now say i think we have it. do you agree?" huge applause. #higgs 11.02am professor higgs asked to say a few words at the press conference but he seems slightly irritated at the suggestion. i say this is not the occasion for that discussion. let us continue with the main topic 10.52am tom chivers found this... 10.44am the press association writes: scientists today hailed the "momentous" discovery of what appears to be the "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the fabric of the universe together. teams at the large hadron collider (lhc), the ?2.6 billion atom smashing machine near geneva, say they have found a new sub-atomic particle "consistent" with the higgs boson. the results are preliminary and more work is needed before the scientists can be sure of what "species" of particle they have captured. but observations carried out so far show it looks and acts like the long-sought particle that has eluded them for 50 years from the guardian asks whether the weeks have been emotional? |they have been extremely intense, full of a lot of emotions 10.38am nick collins, the daily telegraph science correspondent, asks whether peter higgs and the cern team deserve a nobel prize. director general rolf heuer replies i don't think my opinion counts but it was great work. 10.19am the press conference opens with a nice gag. cern director general rolf heuer says i think there could be worse days in the life of a director general of cern 10.15am they may know how to find a minute atomic particle but they can't use a microphone. press conference delayed by sound technical difficulties. 10.12 peter higgs has said this is "really the most incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime" twitter: nick collins - the speakers have just arrived and sat down for the press conference and had about 50 cameras shoved in their faces. rock star moment. 10.08am the announcement has been called a "momentous day for science. telegraph reporters ceri perkins , and scientists believe they have captured the elusive "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the physical fabric of the universe together. the historic announcement came in a progress report from the large hadron collider particle accelerator. professor john womersley, chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." scientists say it is a 5 sigma result which means they are 99.999% sure they have found a new particle. twitter: nick collins - "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." twitter: nick collins - standing ovation at cern. dg then turns to video link and asks for applause from ichep crowd in melbourne. #showman 10.00am speaking on bbc radio 4's today programme, scientists explained this could be be "one of the most significant steps" in human understanding of the universe and an "historic day" for physics. professor jim virdee , head of physics at imperial college, said: i suspect it's going to be a historic day. i think it will be one of the most significant steps we have taken in our understanding of how the universe works. calling it the "key missing element" in the understanding of the universe, he said: "finding the higgs boson will actually allow us to understand very deeply what's going on and open up more questions. "it's a portal from 20th century science to 21st century science." he added it could be "a great example" of a discovery that would "change they way we live". professor jon butterworth , head of astronomy and physics at ucl, said: i think it's going to be very exciting. we are really looking over the threshold in physics that we never look over before. he added a potential discovery would "give us clues to answer the other big questions." so after all last night's confusion over the large hadron collider and the higgs boson - have they found it? or have they simply made a series of home videos? - it appears that the elusive particle, or something like it, really has been found. i've been watching the live stream (see our live blog, here), and i have to admit it's several vertical kilometres above my pay grade, but here is what i've managed to glean from it. first, as was hinted yesterday, the cms detector - one of the two major experiments at the large hadron collider - has definitely found something. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the experiment, said they have seen something "very strong, very solid" at the 125gev (gigaelectronvolt) mass, where they had thought they'd seen something in december. the first slide showed a curve of results, with a single bump up at 125gev. "it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks: "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. prof peter higgs, the theorist who first predicted the existence of the higgs boson, has told the guardian that he "shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge" this evening. congratulations are due to everyone involved, it would seem. twitter: tom whipple - professor higgs: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." 9.35am "it's hard not to get excited by these results," adds cern research director sergio bertolucci professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson.

T	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened - telegraph
C	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened higgs boson: an important day for british physics 12.46pm we are wrapping up for today. thanks for joining us and please buy tomorrow's newspaper for all the latest analysis. 12.20pm prof themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, who has worked on the lhc, said: "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle. half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature. 12.10pm things became a little emotional earlier as prof higgs listened to the announcement twitter: simon pegg - was higgs boson where they left it? i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them. 11.57am comedian dara o briain explains @laurenlaverne without higgs everything would just ping around at the speed of light, not interact, and we couldn't, y'know, sit on stuff 11.46am lhc achievement is the equivalent of the discovery of dna and man landing on the moon, claims professor sir peter knight , president of the institute of physics (iop). this is the physics version of the discovery of dna. it sets the course for a brand new adventure in our efforts to understand the fabric of our universe." this is a remarkable achievement. fifteen years of international collaboration and hard work constructing the large hadron collider has paid off. akin to a moon mission, one of the most remarkable things about the hunt for the higgs is how the effort has caught the public imagination. not since the apollo missions 40 years ago has there been such a sense of popular excitement around scientific discovery. long may this continue to inspire the next generation of scientists." peter clarke , professor of physics at the university of edinburgh, provides a helpful analogy to help explain just how important the higgs boson is to the understanding of physics. asked to describe it in layman's terms, he explained: if we were discovering the human body and found a little finger on one hand, after we had already seen five fingers on the other hand, that would be important but not unexpected. it's not really adding much to what we already know. some sorts of particles can be like that - very important but predicted. this is like discovering the heart; without it the entire model of the human body does not work. that is the significance of this particle. he has also explained the higgs mechanism, using the example of trying to push a balloon (representing a massless particle) through a room while wearing a blindfold. if that room were to be filled with treacle, he explained, the balloon would feel heavy. the treacle in this instance is comparable to the higgs mechanism, permanently giving the object mass. prof clarke added he hopes the work of peter higgs work and his colleagues is considered worthy of a nobel prize. "i think many of us have believed for a long time that this work is very close to being deserving of a nobel prize. i hope it's considered worthy." 11.16am controversial question. the panel is asked how they can justify the huge budget in light of the economic crisis around the world. director general rolf heuer replies if there is no fundamental science then there is no basis for applied science. we have to strike a balance. 23 years ago the world wide web was born here. it has changed the world dramatically 11.05am ask a silly question and you get a serious answer. when a journalist asked the scientists what was the best and worst metaphor in relation to the higgs boson, they got a brusque reply from the director general twitter: nick collins - rolf-dieter heuer, dg of cern: "as a layman, i would now say i think we have it. do you agree?" huge applause. #higgs 11.02am professor higgs asked to say a few words at the press conference but he seems slightly irritated at the suggestion. i say this is not the occasion for that discussion. let us continue with the main topic 10.52am tom chivers found this... 10.44am the press association writes: scientists today hailed the "momentous" discovery of what appears to be the "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the fabric of the universe together. teams at the large hadron collider (lhc), the ?2.6 billion atom smashing machine near geneva, say they have found a new sub-atomic particle "consistent" with the higgs boson. the results are preliminary and more work is needed before the scientists can be sure of what "species" of particle they have captured. but observations carried out so far show it looks and acts like the long-sought particle that has eluded them for 50 years from the guardian asks whether the weeks have been emotional? |they have been extremely intense, full of a lot of emotions 10.38am nick collins, the daily telegraph science correspondent, asks whether peter higgs and the cern team deserve a nobel prize. director general rolf heuer replies i don't think my opinion counts but it was great work. 10.19am the press conference opens with a nice gag. cern director general rolf heuer says i think there could be worse days in the life of a director general of cern 10.15am they may know how to find a minute atomic particle but they can't use a microphone. press conference delayed by sound technical difficulties. 10.12 peter higgs has said this is "really the most incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime" twitter: nick collins - the speakers have just arrived and sat down for the press conference and had about 50 cameras shoved in their faces. rock star moment. 10.08am the announcement has been called a "momentous day for science. telegraph reporters ceri perkins , and scientists believe they have captured the elusive "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the physical fabric of the universe together. the historic announcement came in a progress report from the large hadron collider particle accelerator. professor john womersley, chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." scientists say it is a 5 sigma result which means they are 99.999% sure they have found a new particle. twitter: nick collins - "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." twitter: nick collins - standing ovation at cern. dg then turns to video link and asks for applause from ichep crowd in melbourne. #showman 10.00am speaking on bbc radio 4's today programme, scientists explained this could be be "one of the most significant steps" in human understanding of the universe and an "historic day" for physics. professor jim virdee , head of physics at imperial college, said: i suspect it's going to be a historic day. i think it will be one of the most significant steps we have taken in our understanding of how the universe works. calling it the "key missing element" in the understanding of the universe, he said: "finding the higgs boson will actually allow us to understand very deeply what's going on and open up more questions. "it's a portal from 20th century science to 21st century science." he added it could be "a great example" of a discovery that would "change they way we live". professor jon butterworth , head of astronomy and physics at ucl, said: i think it's going to be very exciting. we are really looking over the threshold in physics that we never look over before. he added a potential discovery would "give us clues to answer the other big questions." so after all last night's confusion over the large hadron collider and the higgs boson - have they found it? or have they simply made a series of home videos? - it appears that the elusive particle, or something like it, really has been found. i've been watching the live stream (see our live blog, here), and i have to admit it's several vertical kilometres above my pay grade, but here is what i've managed to glean from it. first, as was hinted yesterday, the cms detector - one of the two major experiments at the large hadron collider - has definitely found something. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the experiment, said they have seen something "very strong, very solid" at the 125gev (gigaelectronvolt) mass, where they had thought they'd seen something in december. the first slide showed a curve of results, with a single bump up at 125gev. "it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks: "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. prof peter higgs, the theorist who first predicted the existence of the higgs boson, has told the guardian that he "shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge" this evening. congratulations are due to everyone involved, it would seem. twitter: tom whipple - professor higgs: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." 9.35am "it's hard not to get excited by these results," adds cern research director sergio bertolucci professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." cern have announced that they have found a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. they are 99.999% sure it is the "god particle" 9.25am good morning on this momentous day. looks like the 50-year search for the elusive higgs boson is almost over. here's some of what we have learnt already. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the cms experiment at the large hadron collider, has announced a "very strong, very solid" finding of a new particle, at a mass of 125gev (gigaelectronvolts), where the experimenters found a hint in december. that is consistent with the predictions for the the higgs boson made by the standard model, the model of elementary physics. now a spokesman for the atlas experiment is speaking. last night, an apparently leaked video hinted that the new particle might have been found. read more in tom chivers's news story here: higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found scottish lecturer found to be 'grandfather of everyone in britain' scientists developing device to 'hack' into brain of stephen hawking higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found

C	scientists believe they have found the long sought-after 'god particle' that shapes the universe, a discovery one excited physicist compared to columbus discovering america. teams of physicists from around the world believe they may have found proof of the theoretical higgs boson that confers mass, the key missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle that determines why nature is the way it is. they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson, the european organisation for nuclear research, or cern, announced in geneva and melbourne on wednesday. while the teams involved in the experiments at the $10 billion large hadron collider particle accelerator near geneva stressed that the results were preliminary, physicists could barely contain their excitement. 'a new particle has been discovered that looks like the higgs boson and the dice are now loaded in favour of a discovery,' said the university of liverpool's head of particle physics, professor themis bowcock. 'based on the cern results alone there appears to be less than one chance in a million that this is fake, which is roughly the same probability as flipping a coin heads-up 21 times in a row,' prof bowcock said. 'very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle.' the discovery of the higgs boson, half a century after it was first proposed, represented a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature, he said. 'for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america.' the experiment's teams are not yet sure if the particle is the long sought-after higgs boson or something more 'exotic'. the next step would be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe, cern said, adding that would take considerable time and data. still, cern director general rolf heuer said it was a milestone and pinning down the new particle's properties would shed light on other mysteries of the universe. 'as a layman, i think we have it, but as a scientist i have to say, 'what do we have?'' he said. 'i think we have a success today. 'we have a discovery, we have discovered a new particle, most probably a higgs boson.' the higgs boson is the key missing piece of the rule book of how elementary particles and forces interact in the universe. that standard model of particle physics describes the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them, cern says. 'all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about four per cent of the total. 'a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96 per cent of the universe that remains obscure.' a spokesman for one of two teams involved in the experiment said the preliminary results were dramatic. 'we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,' cms experiment spokesman joe incandela said. prof bowcock said the modern understanding of physics relied on the existence of the higgs boson, which interacted with other particles, making some very heavy while leaving others light, shaping the universe as we know it. 'for the last 40 years it has allowed us to understand phenomena such as light, the way the sun burns, and how atoms and nuclei are held together. without the higgs there would be no stars and ultimately no life.' there's talk that the man who first theorised the existence of the god particle in the 1960s, british physicist peter higgs, may receive a nobel prize if it has, in fact, been found. a british judge has ruled samsung's galaxy tablet isn't cool enough to be confused with apple's ipad. internet doomsday virus fizzles the so-called internet doomsday virus appeared to pose no major problems in the hours after a fix expired. ugandan it students makes apps fortune ugandan it student abdu sekalala has made a fortune in developing mobile phone applications. vodafone has admitted 21 charges under the nz fair trading act after promotions made misleading claims. new zealand has been ranked 13th in the world in the 2012 global innovation index.

T	god particle and #39;may have finally been discovered and #39;
C	the higgs boson is the final building block that has been missing from the "standard model", which describes the structure of matter in the universe. it combines two forces of nature and shows that they are, in fact, different aspects of a more fundamental force. the particle is also responsible for the existence of mass in the elementary particles. weizmann institute scientists have been prominent participants in this research from its onset. most of us experience the world as a diverse and complex place. but the physicists among us are not content with visible reality. they are striving to get to the bottom of that reality and to see whether it is, as they think, based on the absolute simplicity displayed by the early universe. they expect to observe a range of particles that are different "ensembles" of a handful of elementary particles. the scientists are hoping to see a unification of the four fundamental forces of nature that act on these particles (the weak force responsible for radioactivity, electromagnetic force, the strong force responsible for the existence of protons and neutrons, and gravitation). the first step in the journey to unify the forces was completed with the almost certain discovery of the higgs particle: the union of two elementary forces - the electromagnetic and weak force, to become the electroweak force. one aspect of the higgs boson, named after the scottish physicist peter higgs, manifests itself in the giving of mass to the weak force carriers - the "w" and "z" particles. in the effort to discover the higgs boson, unify the fundamental forces and understand the origin of mass in the universe, scientists built the world's largest machine: a particle accelerator nestled in a 27-km-long circular tunnel, 100 meters beneath the border between france and switzerland, in the european particle physics laboratory, cern, near geneva. this accelerator, called lhc (large hadron collider), accelerates beams of protons up to 99.999998 percent the speed of light. according to the theory of relativity, this increases their mass by 7,500 times that of their normal resting mass. the accelerator aims the beams straight at each other, causing collisions that release so much energy, the protons themselves explode. for much less than the blink of an eye, conditions similar to those that existed in the universe in the first fraction of a second after the big bang are present in the accelerator. as a result, particles of matter are turned into energy, in accordance with albert einstein's famous equation describing the conversion of matter into energy: e=mc2. the energy then propagates through space and the system cools. consequently, energy turns back into particles of matter and the process is repeated until particles that can exist in reality as we know it are formed. the collisions produce energetic particles, some of which exist for extremely short periods of time. the only way to discern their existence is to identify the footprints they leave behind. for this purpose, a variety of particle detectors were developed, each optimized for capturing particular types of particles. the likelihood of creating the higgs boson in a single collision is similar to that of randomly extracting a specific living cell from the leaf of a plant, out of all the plants growing on earth. the findings of the study were reported by lhc particle accelerator scientists at the european laboratory for particle physics, cern, near geneva. god particle video leaked to website the cern physics laboratory near geneva appeared to have leaked crucial details of its hunt for the long-sought higgs boson - 'god particle' on tuesday when it accidentally posted a video announcing the discovery of a new particle on its website. cern, which takes credit for inventing the world wide web, inadvertently released a video interview on its website dated 4 july 2012 in which spokesman joe incandela states the lab has "observed a new particle". a press officer at the laboratory blamed a technical glitch for the video going live. the interview was taken down shortly after. speaking on the video, incandela stopped short of claiming the particle was the higgs boson, saying more work was needed to be sure. "we have quite strong evidence that there's something there. it's properties are still going to take us a little bit of time," the guardian quoted him as saying. the details incandela revealed suggest it has the hallmarks of the higgs particle. "we can see that it decays into two photons, for example, which tells us it's a boson, it's a particle with integer spin, and we know its mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the proton. and this is very significant," incandela said. "this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all this, which i think we will. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks," he said. a spokesperson for cern said that the video went live on the internet due to a "technical fault". they added that the lab had recorded several videos in advance with spokespersons at the lab. post your views on the story - via your facebook profile or using the comment box below

T	a new particle could be physics' holy grail | ndtv.com
C	aspen (colorado): physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said today that they had discovered a new particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a long sought particle that is a key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern in an interview from his office outside of geneva. his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end of the longest most expensive manhunt in the history of science and, if scientists are lucky, could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. ( read: cern on the experiment ) dr heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, the heaviest subatomic particle yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data, wednesday called the discovery, " very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday saturday, bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. that was a scene that was duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, to los angeles to chicago to princeton, new york city, london, and beyond, everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. women take top two slots in civil services ex ... honest criticism should help mamata learn fro ... atmosphere of intolerance towards criticism i ... what is god particle? the theoretical higgs particle has been likened to a celebrity, say george clooney, walking down a street with a gaggle of photographers (the higgs field) clustered around him. uncovered: so what's on the cover of j.k. rowling's first adult novel?

C	peter jenni, member of cern, talks during the australian science media centre background briefing on the search for the higgs boson in melbourne july 4, 2012. (reuters/mal fairclough) geneva/london: scientists at the cern research center have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of britain's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and even life. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists don't yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model, a variant of the higgs or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. we invite all our readers to share with us their views and comments about this article.

C	cern scientists find the god of all particles wed, jul 04, 2012 at 14:19 | source : pti cern scientists find the god of all particles the five-decade-long hunt for the elusive higgs boson or the "god particle" has reached a milestone, with scientists at the cern claiming today that they have discovered a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to be crucial for formation of the universe. joe incandela, leader of one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom smasher, told a packed audience of scientists at the european center for nuclear research (cern) that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. meanwhile, the second team of physicists also claimed they have observed a new particle, probably the elusive higgs boson. the announcements were made to huge applause by scientists including peter higgs who first suggested the existence of the particle in 1964. in a statement, cern said the particle they found at lhc is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," but more data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. cern scientists discover new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson from dj eu officials spain aid cap of 100 bn euros 'should be enough' subscribe to moneycontrol newsletters

C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , near geneva, home of the large hadron collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson , the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics . "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simplest proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle higgs boson discovered? live coverage of the cern announcement higgs boson: us physicists find strongest evidence yet of 'god particle' why the higgs particle hunt was always going to be a waiting game higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover new subatomic particle follow all the top science stories of the day on twitter quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

C	published: wednesday, jul 4, 2012, 14:24 ist place: geneva | agency: pti the five-decade-long hunt for the elusive higgs boson or the "god particle" has reached a milestone, with scientists at the cern claiming on wednesday that they have discovered a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to be crucial for formation of the universe. joe incandela, leader of one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom smasher, told a packed audience of scientists at the european center for nuclear research (cern) that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. meanwhile, the second team of physicists also claimed they have observed a new particle, probably the elusive higgs boson. the announcements were made to huge applause by scientists including peter higgs who first suggested the existence of the particle in 1964. in a statement, cern said the particle they found at lhc is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," but more data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces.

C	published: wednesday, jul 4, 2012, 14:24 ist | updated: wednesday, jul 4, 2012, 15:42 ist in a 'quantum' leap in physics, scientists on wednesday claimed to have spotted a sub-atomic particle "consistent" with the higgs boson or 'god particle', believed to be a crucial building block that led to the formation of the universe. scientists at switzerland's european centre for nuclear research (cern) research centre made the historic announcement, in a major milestone in the 50-year search for the elusive higgs, that is believed to have been responsible for lending mass to the particles that eventually formed the stars and the planets after the big bang 13.7 billion years ago. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. joe incandela, the leader of cms, one of the two teams at the world's biggest atom smasher, told a packed audience of scientists at the cern that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a "discovery". but he did not yet confirm that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. a second team of physicists atlas also claimed they have observed a new particle, probably the elusive higgs boson. "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev," said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, "but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication".

"the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe," a cern statement said. cern director general rolf heuer said it was a milestone.

"the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." cern said positive identification of the new particle's characteristics would take considerable time and data. the standard model of particle physics described the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them, cern said. "all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about four per cent of the total. "a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96 per cent of the universe that remains obscure." physicists have been trying for 30 years to find evidence that the theoretical subatomic particle exists, leading to the cern experiments using the $10 billion large hadron collider particle accelerator, 100 metres underground near geneva. a summary of experiments conducted by one of the two teams at the large hadron collider said further analysis of the particle was needed.

"the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." cern said positive identification of the new particle's characteristics would take considerable time and data. the standard model of particle physics described the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them, cern said.

T	cern announces new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson
C	cern announces new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson geneva/london, july 4 (reuters): scientists at the cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of britain's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle, told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and even life. the theory goes that without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model, which describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists don't yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model, a variant of the higgs or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter.

T	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , near geneva, home of the large hadron collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson , the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics . "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simplest proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle higgs boson discovered? live coverage of the cern announcement higgs boson: us physicists find strongest evidence yet of 'god particle' why the higgs particle hunt was always going to be a waiting game higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover new subatomic particle follow all the top science stories of the day on twitter quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of god particle - hoggs boson | 9news.com
C	aurora - police and firefighters are putting more boots on the ground as they ... park county - the fine for having a campfire or shooting guns in park county is ... st. louis (ap) - jeff francis worked five solid innings before the colorado ... denver (ap) - top-scoring defenseman erik johnson is staying with the colorado ... geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, `"what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration."

T	scientists may have found 'god particle' | the courier-mail
C	scientists may have found 'god particle' scientists say they have found a new particle consistent with the long-sought "god particle". the physicists say they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson, a theoretical particle that is key to the scientific understanding of all matter. the european organisation for nuclear research or cern said the discovery was a milestone in the understanding of nature. physicists stressed the results presented at a joint conference in melbourne and geneva were preliminary. they were unsure if the particle was the long sought-after higgs boson, or god particle, or something more "exotic". "the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe," a cern statement said. cern director general rolf heuer said it was a milestone. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," he said. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." god particle2 british physicist peter higgs arrives for the opening of a seminar to deliver the latest update in the 50-year bid to explain a riddle of fundamental matter in the search for a particle called the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin, near geneva. picture: afp source: afp a spokesman for one of two teams involved in the experiment said the preliminary results were dramatic. "this is indeed a new particle," cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela said. "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. "the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." cern said positive identification of the new particle's characteristics would take considerable time and data. the standard model of particle physics described the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them, cern said. "all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about four per cent of the total. "a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96 per cent of the universe that remains obscure." physicists have been trying for 30 years to find evidence that the theoretical subatomic particle exists, leading to the cern experiments using the $10 billion large hadron collider particle accelerator, 100 metres underground near geneva. a summary of experiments conducted by one of the two teams at the large hadron collider said further analysis of the particle was needed. "more data are necessary to establish whether this new particle has all the properties of the sm higgs boson or whether some do not match, implying physics beyond the standard model," a statement on the cms results said. a spokesman for the second team atlas, fabiola gianotti, said they observed clear signs of a new particle. "more data and more study will be needed to determine the new particle's properties." the higgs boson is the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle, an australian scientist said. professor anthony thomas, based at the university of adelaide, said it was the most important and profound discovery in particle physics in almost 30 years. "the higgs represents the key missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle that is the famous standard model of nuclear and particle physics," prof thomas said. "it has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation."

T	physicists show evidence of new subatomic particle seen as key to explaining the universe - south florida sun-sentinel.com
C	geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed.

T	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind | my sinchew
C	geneva, july 4, 2012 (afp) - after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp.

T	higgs boson found: scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' | mail online
C	scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' discovery of particle is most important in physics in decades leading physicists watch announcement at cern in switzerland end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle last jigsaw piece that proves our view of universe is right audience includes professor peter higgs who suggested boson's existence 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass by rob waugh published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 04:52 est, 4 july 2012 comments ( 78 ) share the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that holds the universe together - is over. scientists at switzerland's cern (the european council for nuclear research) announced the discovery of the particle to an audience including professor peter higgs, who first suggested the existence of the particle four decades ago. the discovery is the biggest leap in physics for decades - filling in a crucial gap in our understanding of the atom. in the long term, the discovery could lead to new technologies. professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, said: 'they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science.' scroll down for live video joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, announces the discovery of a particle that corresponds to theories of the higgs boson at cern today the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle why the higgs matters - what the new particle actually means the existence of the higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. the higgs is the last missing piece of the standard model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the higgs is the last jigsaw piece. if the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the big bang, an invisible force known as the higgs field formed. this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles - or higgs bosons.as other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the higgs boson will be long term, but they could be in fields as diverse as medicine, computing and manufacturing. experts compare the search for the higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. the idea of the electron - a subatomic particle - was first floated in 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patients. 'this is indeed a new particle,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. the discovery fills in the last gap in the 'standard model' of physics - proving einstein right, and possibly leading to new technologies built on our understanding of the particle. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. more... 'britain's atlantis' found at bottom of north sea - a huge undersea kingdom swallowed by the sea in 6500bc a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' is the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. 'we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev,' said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, 'but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.' 'the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,' said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. 'the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.' 'it's hard not to get excited by these results,' said cern research director sergio bertolucci. ' we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point.' british physicist peter higgs (right) is welcomed by european organization for nuclear research (cern) director-general rolf-dieter heuer (left) british physicist peter higgs arrives for the conference near geneva inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider the 'god particle' - why the higgs hunt caused controversy the search for the particle caused controversy as members of the public feared that the high-energy collisions could cause a black hole or an interdimensional gateway in switzerland. religious groups also objected to the use of the term 'god particle' - although cern's scientists dislike the term just as much. nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman nicknamed the boson the 'god particle' in 1993 - which makes it popular in the media but has angered many scientists, including professor higgs himself. at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. physicists needed the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a model of the large hadron collider (lhc) tunnel is seen in the cern (european organization for nuclear research) visitors' center a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.' cern announcement live video: prof higgs makes rare public appearance at press conference

C	scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' discovery of particle is most important in physics in decades leading physicists watch announcement at cern in switzerland end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle last jigsaw piece that proves our view of universe is right audience includes professor peter higgs who suggested boson's existence 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass by rob waugh published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 04:10 est, 4 july 2012 comments ( 32 ) share the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that holds the universe together - is over. scientists at switzerland's cern (the european council for nuclear research) announced the discovery of the particle to an audience including professor peter higgs, who first suggested the existence of the particle four decades ago. the discovery is the biggest leap in physics for decades - filling in the last gap in our understanding of physics. in the long term, the discovery could lead to new technologies. professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, said: 'they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science.' scroll down for live video joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, announces the discovery of a particle that corresponds to theories of the higgs boson at cern today the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle why the higgs matters - what the new particle actually means the existence of the higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. the higgs is the last missing piece of the standard model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the higgs is the last jigsaw piece. if the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the big bang, an invisible force known as the higgs field formed. this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles - or higgs bosons.as other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the higgs boson will be long term, but they could be in fields as diverse as medicine, computing and manufacturing. experts compare the search for the higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. the idea of the electron - a subatomic particle - was first floated in 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patients. 'this is indeed a new particle,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. the discovery fills in the last gap in the 'standard model' of physics - proving einstein right, and possibly leading to new technologies built on our understanding of the particle. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. more... 'britain's atlantis' found at bottom of north sea - a huge undersea kingdom swallowed by the sea in 6500bc a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' is the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. 'we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev,' said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, 'but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.' 'the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,' said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. 'the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.' 'it's hard not to get excited by these results,' said cern research director sergio bertolucci. ' we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point.' british physicist peter higgs (right) is welcomed by european organization for nuclear research (cern) director-general rolf-dieter heuer (left) british physicist peter higgs arrives for the conference near geneva inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider the 'god particle' - why the higgs hunt caused controversy the search for the particle caused controversy as members of the public feared that the high-energy collisions could cause a black hole or an interdimensional gateway in switzerland. religious groups also objected to the use of the term 'god particle' - although cern's scientists dislike the term just as much. nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman nicknamed the boson the 'god particle' in 1993 - which makes it popular in the media but has angered many scientists, including professor higgs himself. at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. physicists needed the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a model of the large hadron collider (lhc) tunnel is seen in the cern (european organization for nuclear research) visitors' center a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.' cern announcement live

T	cern: ?we have a discovery!? | cosmos magazine
C	cern: "we have a discovery!" wednesday, 4 july 2012 melbourne: high energy physics experiments at cern have both observed a new particle, consistent with higgs boson, but with hints it might be something exotic, beyond the standard model of physics. in a two-hour conference, the spokespersons from two cern experiments - the atlas detector and the cms detector - presented their results to a packed auditorium at cern, in switzerland and france, that was linked live with the 36th international conference on high energy physics, being held in melbourne, australia. both experiments announced an observation of a new particle, in the mass range of 125-126 gev. "it's the heaviest ever found" "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest ever found," said joe incandela, the spokesperson for cms, in a cern press release. "we have a discovery. we have a discovery of a new particle," concluded rolf heuer, the director general of cern. "[the new particle] is consistent with a higgs boson ? but which one?" he asks. the physicists are unsure if it is, in fact, the higgs boson predicted by the standard model of physics, which describes all the fundamental particles of matter. is it something more exotic? "are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient in the standard model of physics? or is it something more exotic?" the cern press statement asks. the higgs boson is the final piece of the standard model, the answer to the question of why particles have different masses. if it is more exotic than the standard model may lie in how this newly discovered particle decays. decay modes the boson is a very short-lived particle, and the atlas and cms detectors can only measure what the higgs boson decays into. in the mass ranges they looked at, there are five ways the higgs boson can decay, producing: two z bosons; two photons; two b quarks; two tau leptons; or two w bosons. "the most important decay is the two photo decay, where both atlas and cms have seen more of this decay than the standard model predicts," said christopher hill from ohio state university, and the deputy physics co-ordinator for cms detector. "if this trend continues as we add more data this year, this would be not just a discovery of the higgs boson, but a discovery of some new physics," he said. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director sergio bertolucci. " we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data." cern: "we have a discovery!" in full" class="active">cern: "we have a discovery!" cuttlefish display split personality to trick mating rivals in full">cuttlefish display split personality to trick mating rivals mental health check for toddlers launched amid controversy in full">mental health check for toddlers launched amid controversy

T	science & technology - eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle
C	science & technology > eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle if physicists can confirm the existence of the higgs boson, the last missing piece in the standard model of physics, the announcement would rank among the most important scientific breakthroughs of the last century. afp photo to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration." following is a factfile on the higgs boson: what is it? the higgs boson is conceived as a sub-atomic particle that confers substance. it is conceived as existing in a treacly, invisible field that was created after the "big bang" and pervades the universe. higgs bosons "stick" to fundamental particles of matter, dragging on them, and then decay themselves into another form. some of these particles interact more with the higgs than others and thus have greater mass, according to the theory. but particles of light, also called photons, are impervious to it and have no mass. why is it important? the origin of mass -- meaning the resistance of an object to being moved -- has been fiercely debated for decades. finding the higgs boson would vindicate the so-called standard model of physics, a theory that developed in the early 1970s, which says the universe is made from 12 particles which provide the building blocks for all matter. these fundamental particles are divided into a bestiary comprising six leptons and six quarks, which have exotic names such as "strange," "up", "tau" and "charm." why is it called the higgs boson? the name comes from a british physicist, peter higgs, today aged 83, who conceived of a field of mass-conferring particles in 1964 and became the first to publish his idea. important theoretical work was also done separately by belgian physicists robert brout, who died in 2011, and francois englert, 79. bosons are non-matter particles which are force carriers, or messengers that act between matter particles. the interaction gives rise to three fundamental forces -- the strong force, the weak force and the electromagnatic force. there is a fourth force, gravity, which is suspected to be caused by a still-to-be found boson named the graviton. how has the higgs been hunted? the quest for the higgs has been carried out at colliders: giant machines that smash particles together and sift through the sub-atomic debris that tumbles out. the big daddy of these is the large hadron collider (lhc), operated by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) in a ring-shaped tunnel deep underground near geneva. smashups generated at the lhc briefly generate temperatures 100,000 times hotter than the sun, replicating the conditions that occurred just after the universe's creation in the "big bang" nearly 14 billion years ago. but these concentrations of energy, while violent, occur only at a tiny scale. on wednesday, cern scientists said they had found a new particle that was "consistent" with the higgs, but further work was needed to determine what it was. why "the god particle"? the higgs has become known as the "god particle," the quip being that, like god, it is extremely powerful, exists everywhere but is hard to find. in fact, the origin of the name is rather less poetic. physicist leon lederman whose draft title was "the goddamn particle," to describe the frustrations of trying to nail the higgs. the pentagon has condemned an apparent u.s. leak contradicting ankara's version of how one of its jets was shot down by syria. us slams leaks as russia says it knows more syrian president al-assad expresses his regret for the downing of a turkish jet, but ankara refuses to back down from its aggressive stance, vowing retribution al-assad regrets jet hit as ankara vows payback when mohamed morsi, the candidate of the muslim brotherhood, was declared the new president of egypt last week, i felt relieved. turkish and greek cypriots both share the same negative view on the deployment of the turkish army to the island, while turkish cypriots demand respect in their relations with ankara, a tesev report reveals no sympathy for turkish army in cyprus: report you might think this would be the h?rku?, turkey's first '100-percent-turkish-made' basic trainer aircraft, whose prototype was revealed last week. there is a shift in russia and china's position on syria that should not be underestimated, a spokesperson for envoy kofi annan said yesterday. un to the west: axis of russia, china sees shift amid all the sound and fury over syria, particularly following the downing of a turkish jet by syrian forces ... a video of an israeli border officer kicking a palestinian boy while he is held by a colleague in hebron released ... video of israeli troop stirs palestine anger turkish artist ??kran moral is exhibiting her video 'bordello' at the bergen kunstmuseum, as part of a group show titled 'desire.' european art scene warmly welcomes turkish artist

T	science & technology - higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind
C	science & technology > higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind if physicists can confirm the existence of the higgs boson, the last missing piece in the standard model of physics, the announcement would rank among the most important scientific breakthroughs of the last century. afp photo after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. "it may be the higgs boson, but it may also be something far bigger, which opens the door towards a new theory that goes beyond the standard model." following is a factfile on the higgs boson: what is it? the higgs boson is conceived as a sub-atomic particle that confers substance. it is conceived as existing in a treacly, invisible field that was created after the "big bang" and pervades the universe. higgs bosons "stick" to fundamental particles of matter, dragging on them, and then decay themselves into another form. some of these particles interact more with the higgs than others and thus have greater mass, according to the theory. but particles of light, also called photons, are impervious to it and have no mass. why is it important? the origin of mass -- meaning the resistance of an object to being moved -- has been fiercely debated for decades. finding the higgs boson would vindicate the so-called standard model of physics, a theory that developed in the early 1970s, which says the universe is made from 12 particles which provide the building blocks for all matter. these fundamental particles are divided into a bestiary comprising six leptons and six quarks, which have exotic names such as "strange," "up", "tau" and "charm." why is it called the higgs boson? the name comes from a british physicist, peter higgs, today aged 83, who conceived of a field of mass-conferring particles in 1964 and became the first to publish his idea. important theoretical work was also done separately by belgian physicists robert brout, who died in 2011, and francois englert, 79. bosons are non-matter particles which are force carriers, or messengers that act between matter particles. the interaction gives rise to three fundamental forces -- the strong force, the weak force and the electromagnatic force. there is a fourth force, gravity, which is suspected to be caused by a still-to-be found boson named the graviton. how has the higgs been hunted? the quest for the higgs has been carried out at colliders: giant machines that smash particles together and sift through the sub-atomic debris that tumbles out. the big daddy of these is the large hadron collider (lhc), operated by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) in a ring-shaped tunnel deep underground near geneva. smashups generated at the lhc briefly generate temperatures 100,000 times hotter than the sun, replicating the conditions that occurred just after the universe's creation in the "big bang" nearly 14 billion years ago. but these concentrations of energy, while violent, occur only at a tiny scale. on wednesday, cern scientists said they had found a new particle that was "consistent" with the higgs, but further work was needed to determine what it was. why "the god particle"? the higgs has become known as the "god particle," the quip being that, like god, it is extremely powerful, exists everywhere but is hard to find. in fact, the origin of the name is rather less poetic. physicist leon lederman whose draft title was "the goddamn particle," to describe the frustrations of trying to nail the higgs. the pentagon has condemned an apparent u.s. leak contradicting ankara's version of how one of its jets was shot down by syria. us slams leaks as russia says it knows more syrian president al-assad expresses his regret for the downing of a turkish jet, but ankara refuses to back down from its aggressive stance, vowing retribution al-assad regrets jet hit as ankara vows payback when mohamed morsi, the candidate of the muslim brotherhood, was declared the new president of egypt last week, i felt relieved. turkish and greek cypriots both share the same negative view on the deployment of the turkish army to the island, while turkish cypriots demand respect in their relations with ankara, a tesev report reveals no sympathy for turkish army in cyprus: report you might think this would be the h?rku?, turkey's first '100-percent-turkish-made' basic trainer aircraft, whose prototype was revealed last week. there is a shift in russia and china's position on syria that should not be underestimated, a spokesperson for envoy kofi annan said yesterday. un to the west: axis of russia, china sees shift amid all the sound and fury over syria, particularly following the downing of a turkish jet by syrian forces ... a video of an israeli border officer kicking a palestinian boy while he is held by a colleague in hebron released ... video of israeli troop stirs palestine anger internationally-funded ngos operating in russia could soon be officially branded as 'foreign agents,' in the latest move of kremlin to crack down on protesters turkish artist ??kran moral is exhibiting her video 'bordello' at the bergen kunstmuseum, as part of a group show titled 'desire.'

T	the power: new subatomic particle could be higgs boson
C	cern scientists discover new subatomic particle that could be the elusive god particle. last modified: 04 jul 2012 09:07 in share email print share feedback cern scientists are expected to reveal whether or not they have discovered a new subatomic particle [epa] scientists at the cern research centre have discovered a new subatomic particle that could be the elusive higgs boson, which is believed to be crucial in the formation of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of the uk's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and even life. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists don't yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model, a variant of the higgs or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting.

T	physicists find evidence of 'god particle' - bostonherald.com
C	geneva - the head of the world's biggest atom smasher says they have discovered a new subatomic particle that is consistent with the long-sought higgs boson known popularly as the "god particle," which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, says "we have a discovery" of a new subatomic particle, a boson, that is "consistent with a higgs boson." higgs boson's existence was predicted decades ago to help explain how the universe works. he spoke after two independent teams at cern said they have both "observed" a new particle. but the teams stopped just shy of claiming outright discovery of the higgs boson itself that is key to our understanding of why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. geneva - physicists say they have all but proven that the "god particle" exists.... ? copyright by the boston herald and herald media. no portion of bostonherald.com or its content may be reproduced without the owner's written permission.

T	god particle: elusive higgs boson discovered? | news.outlookindia.com
C	the five-decade-long hunt for the elusive higgs boson or the "god particle" has reached a milestone, with scientists at the cern claiming today that they have discovered a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to be crucial for the formation of the universe. joe incandela, leader of one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom collider, told a packed audience of scientists at the european center for nuclear research (cern) that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. meanwhile, the second team of physicists also claimed they have observed a new particle, probably the elusive higgs boson. the announcements were made to huge applause by scientists including peter higgs who first suggested the existence of the particle in 1964. in a statement, cern said the particle they found at the lhc is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," but more data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces.

T	cern announces discovery of particle, consistent with higgs boson (wired uk)
C	leave a comment two experiments at the ?6 billion physics laboratory cern have observed a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), which is consistent with the elusive higgs boson . "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." a five sigma references a level of certainty. "five sigma is the usual particle physics threshold for discovery," explained atlas member and celebrity physicist brian cox. "it roughly means that you're 99.9999 percent sure," the floppy-haired tv scientist tweeted . the next step will be to prepare the results for publication, cross-check them and then determine the precise nature of the new particle. that will test whether the particle's properties are as expected for the long-sought higgs boson. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director-general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." discovery of the higgs boson would solve a 45-odd-year conundrum about why the building blocks of matter have any mass at all. edinburgh university physicist peter higgs proposed that atoms receive their mass as they wade through an invisible field that's spread throughout the cosmos, called the higgs field. to find evidence for its existence, the lhc particle accelerator makes protons move at close to the speed of light, before smashing them into each other. this spectacular head-on collision causes other types of particles to splinter off. physicists at cern hoped that one such particle would be the higgs boson -- a quantum of the higgs field. there's little hope of seeing one directly as it would rapidly decay into a more stable subatomic particle . but that decay would leave behind a telltale fingerprint, and an exciting bump in the data. peter higgs, still at the university of edinburgh, welcomed the results. "scientists at cern are to be congratulated on today's results, which are a great achievement for the large hadron collider and other experiments leading up to this." "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place." image: cern press / rainer hungershausen / cc by-nc-nd 2.0

T	cempaka humanity: higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle
C	'god particle' that gives mass to the universe thought to have been found in large hadron collider, announce scientists guardian.co.uk , ian sample at cern, geneva, wednesday 4 july 2012 a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , near geneva, home of the large hadron collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson , the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics . "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo, a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simplest proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. related articles: factbox: what is the big bang? what is the higgs boson and why is it important?

T	new subatomic particle could be higgs boson - europe - al jazeera english
C	new subatomic particle could be higgs boson "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer [epa] after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists have said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) on wednesday after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle back in 1964, expressed joy. standard model "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. mathematical quirk over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean.

C	physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson international consortium of scientists includes a large caltech contingent the compact muon solenoid (cms) detector at the large hadron collider (lhc). [credit: cern] physicists at the large hadron collider (lhc) in geneva, switzerland, have discovered a new particle that may be the long-sought higgs boson, the fundamental particle that is thought to endow elementary particles with mass. "this is a momentous time in the history of particle physics and in scientific exploration-the implications are profound," says harvey newman, professor of physics at the california institute of technology (caltech). "this is experimental science at its best." the international team of scientists and engineers-which includes a large contingent from caltech, led by newman and maria spiropulu, professor of physics-says it needs more data to determine for certain if the particle they've discovered is indeed the higgs boson predicted by the standard model, the theory that describes how all particles interact. the results so far, however, show that it has many of the properties expected for such a particle. "one of the most exciting aspects of this observation is that the road remains open for a vast range of 'lookalike' alternatives, where any deviation from the standard model would point the way to the existence of other new particles or forces of nature," newman says. regardless of the exact identity of the new particle, cern's scientists say, the highly anticipated discovery heralds a new era in physics. the physicists revealed their latest results at a seminar at the european center for nuclear research (cern) in geneva, which was shared with the world with a live webcast and the evo (enabling virtual organizations) system developed at caltech. the discovery itself is based on the analysis of an unprecedented amount of data that was collected by the two main detectors at the lhc-the compact muon solenoid (cms) and a toroidal lhc apparatus (atlas). the data was collected with the lhc running at 7 teraelectron volts (tev, a unit of energy) in 2011 and 8 tev in 2012. the caltech team is part of the cms collaboration. using the cms detector, the physicists identified signals that point to a new particle with a mass of 125 gigaelectron volts (gev, a unit of mass; in comparison, the mass of a proton is about 1 gev). the team running the atlas detector, which searches for the higgs using a different method, reported similar results. "this is an incredible, exciting moment," says spiropulu. "even these early results give us important hints as to how mass in the universe came to be. together with hundreds of our colleagues caltech scientists have worked for decades to reach this point: building multiple generations of experiments; designing and building detectors to precisely measure photons, electrons, and muons, which are keys to the discovery; and inventing worldwide systems that empower thousands of physicists throughout the world to collaborate day and night, share and analyze the data, and develop the new techniques leading to this great result." to search for the higgs, physicists have had to comb through the remains of trillions of particle collisions produced by the lhc, which accelerates protons around a ring almost five miles wide to nearly the speed of light. as the protons careen toward each other, a small fraction of them collide, creating other particles such as the higgs. it is estimated that it takes one billion collisions to make just one higgs boson. the higgs is fleeting, however, and quickly decays into lighter particles, which are the traces that allow the higgs to be detected and analyzed. the higgs is predicted to decay in several different ways, or channels, each resulting in different particles. cms focuses mainly on the decay channels that result in two photons or two other particles called z bosons. it was by measuring and analyzing these and other decay particles that the physicists were able to discover the potential higgs. when all the decays are taken into account in combination, the scientists announced, the data for a signal corresponding to a standard model higgs boson have a statistical significance of five sigmas. this means the signal is highly unlikely to be the result of a statistical fluke caused by some rare, background fluctuation. only when data are significant to five sigmas are physicists confident enough to declare a discovery. last december, evidence seen in the data from cms generated plenty of excitement as a result of an excess of events-a slight surplus in particle collision events over what would have been expected if the higgs does not exist-with a statistical significance of just three sigmas. the higgs boson is the last remaining fundamental particle predicted by the standard model yet to be detected, and hopes of detecting it was one of the chief reasons for building the lhc. the lhc accelerator, along with the cms and atlas experiments, are arguably the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. despite its many successes, the standard model is incomplete-it does not incorporate gravity or dark matter, for example. one of the goals of physicists, then, is to develop more complete theories that better explain the composition of the universe and what happened during the first moments after the big bang. discovering the higgs boson-or a particle like it-is essential for developing these new theories. the measurements of the new particle, the physicists say, are so far consistent-within statistical uncertainty-with the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. still, they need more data to know for sure whether it is the predicted higgs or something stranger, a higgs lookalike-a prospect that many theorists have long been anticipating.

T	cern confirms discovery of new 'god particle'-like boson | gma news online | the go-to site for filipinos everywhere
C	cern confirms discovery of new 'god particle'-like boson at a press conference at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) auditorium on july 4 in geneva, switzerland, physicists say they have found a new subatomic particle. the new particle has properties that are "consistent" with the long sought-after higgs boson, but scientists fell short of confirming it as such. the god particle the higgs boson is commonly called the "god particle" because a "theory of almost everything" rests largely on the confirmation of its existence. since the 1960's, scientists have been in search of the "standard model" of particle physics. this theory seeks to explain all interactions between all known particles -hence, it is a "theory of almost everything." the decades-long search for the higgs culminated in the construction of the large hadron collider research facility, which has been the site of parallel experiments - cms and atlas - conducted by teams comprised of thousands of physicists from around the world. "we have observed a new boson with a mass of 125.3 ? 0.6 gev at 4.9 sigma significance," said joe incandela, cms experiment spokesperson, to thunderous applause from the audience. he however stopped short of naming the new particle. atlas spokesperson fabiola gionatti followed up with a presentation of the results of her own team's experiments, which also supported the existence of a boson with "god particle"-like properties. however, although the newly-discovered particle is consistent with the higgs boson, scientists are cautious to make that declaration pending further tests. "we are entering the era of 'higgs' measurements. this is just the beginning," gionatti confirmed. us atom-smashers at fermilab may have found 'god particle' physicists' atom-smashing quest inspires french movie director scientists find signs of missing 'god particle' higgs boson may be a mirage, scientists hint physicists find antimatter in heavens above south atlantic 'big bang' scientists map cautious plan for 2011 sidelined cern collider gets a new, formal sendoff

C	it could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. geneva/london - scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. "we have indeed discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson," john womersley, head of a british public research body, told journalists and scientists in london on wednesday. "these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe." joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." cern's director general rolph heuer said: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it." addressing the scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer asked: "would you agree?" they burst into applause. peter higgs, the 83-year-old british physicist who proposed the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s, was at cern to welcome the news. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes brimming, he told the symposium: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model. it could also be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva and london to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn. "we still much we don't know about particles - this is only the beginning of a new journey. we have closed one chapter and opened another," peter knight of britain's institute of physics told reuters. oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters : "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. "but we can't yet say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." higgs called it a great achievement for the large hadron collider, the 27-km long particle accelerator built in a tunnel underneath the french-swiss border where experiments to search for the higgs boson have taken place.

C	scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' discovery of particle is most important in physics in decades leading physicists watch announcement at cern in switzerland end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle last jigsaw piece that proves our view of universe is right audience includes professor peter higgs who suggested boson's existence 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass by rob waugh published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 04:52 est, 4 july 2012 comments ( 81 ) share the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that holds the universe together - is over. scientists at switzerland's cern (the european council for nuclear research) announced the discovery of the particle to an audience including professor peter higgs, who first suggested the existence of the particle four decades ago. the discovery is the biggest leap in physics for decades - filling in a crucial gap in our understanding of the atom. in the long term, the discovery could lead to new technologies. professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, said: 'they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science.' scroll down for live video joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, announces the discovery of a particle that corresponds to theories of the higgs boson at cern today the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle why the higgs matters - what the new particle actually means the existence of the higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. the higgs is the last missing piece of the standard model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the higgs is the last jigsaw piece. if the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the big bang, an invisible force known as the higgs field formed. this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles - or higgs bosons.as other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the higgs boson will be long term, but they could be in fields as diverse as medicine, computing and manufacturing. experts compare the search for the higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. the idea of the electron - a subatomic particle - was first floated in 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patients. 'this is indeed a new particle,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. the discovery fills in the last gap in the 'standard model' of physics - proving einstein right, and possibly leading to new technologies built on our understanding of the particle. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. more... 'britain's atlantis' found at bottom of north sea - a huge undersea kingdom swallowed by the sea in 6500bc a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' is the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. 'we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev,' said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, 'but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.' 'the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,' said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. 'the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.' 'it's hard not to get excited by these results,' said cern research director sergio bertolucci. ' we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point.' british physicist peter higgs (right) is welcomed by european organization for nuclear research (cern) director-general rolf-dieter heuer (left) british physicist peter higgs arrives for the conference near geneva inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider the 'god particle' - why the higgs hunt caused controversy the search for the particle caused controversy as members of the public feared that the high-energy collisions could cause a black hole or an interdimensional gateway in switzerland. religious groups also objected to the use of the term 'god particle' - although cern's scientists dislike the term just as much. nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman nicknamed the boson the 'god particle' in 1993 - which makes it popular in the media but has angered many scientists, including professor higgs himself. at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. physicists needed the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a model of the large hadron collider (lhc) tunnel is seen in the cern (european organization for nuclear research) visitors' center a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.' cern announcement live video: prof higgs makes rare public appearance at press conference

T	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , near geneva, home of the large hadron collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simplest proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: "this is sensational news and quite brilliant science. without doubt, cern has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level. i have waited over 20 years for this moment and am thrilled by the news. the excitement will continue now, as we all try to figure out just how this thing behaves." john ellis, who has worked at cern since the 1970s, said the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0.

T	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind - yahoo!7
C	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind geneva (afp) - after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp.

C	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind geneva (afp) - after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp.

T	new particle resembling higgs boson found | down to earth
C	more data needed to confirm if its higgs boson; indian researchers played a major role in the discovery of the elusive particle researchers at the large hadron collider for several years have been trying to simulate conditions just after the bing bang to see the higgs boson (credit: maximilien brice) scientists with the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) say they have discovered a new subatomic particle that is consistent with the long-sought after higgs boson popularly known as the "god particle". the elusive particle is believed to help all matter in the universe acquire mass. the higgs particle has been the subject of a decades-old hunt after it was first proposed in the 1960s. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said rolf heuer, director general of the cern, at a press conference at geneva. "the discovery of a particle, consistent with the higgs, opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," he added. indian touch while the world remains abuzz about the discovery, for india, the finding holds special significance. the higgs boson finding was aided by researchers from delhi university, bhabha atomic research centre, punjab university, tata institute of fundamental research (tifr) and saha institute of nuclear physics (sinp). naba k mondal, senior professor at the department of high energy physics with tifr says, "india has contributed in two major ways-providing instrumentation for the experiment and human resource for data analysis." many significant parts of the cms experiment, one of the two experiments on the higgs boson (the other is atlas, were built by tifr. furthermore, a number of theorists from india are constantly looking at the data generated, making sense of it and publishing papers to advance knowledge in the field. tifr alone has fielded some 10 researchers in the cms experiment. sukalyan chattopadhyay, professor at sinp, says numbers do not give a complete picture of india's role in the landmark findings. chattopadhyay, who is india's project leader for another experiment-alice-at cern, says sinp played a big role in understanding the mechanics of the detectors of the cms experiment. "out of some 3,000 physicists at cms, around 60 are from india. while this may be a small number, it doesn't tell the entire story," he says. "we've not only played a major role in provider hardware for the experiments, but also providing huge help with data analytics," chattopadhyay says. boson simplified if scientists can prove the presence of the subatomic particles (particles smaller than even the atom), it would greatly enhance our understanding of how the universe works. the standard model of particle physics explains how particles and various forces interact inside the universe, but does not provide any explanation on how particles acquire mass. to explain the gaping hole in the model, english physicist peter higgs and others proposed the theory of higgs field. right after the big bang, the mega astronomical event that purportedly created the universe, the particles that were created had no mass, probably because of the extremely high temperature. however, as the universe evolved and cooled down, a higgs field was created which contained the higgs boson particles. when particles enter this field, they attract higgs bosons around them and gain mass. efforts at the large hadron collider (lhc) have been underway for the past few years to find the higgs boson. as the particle is short-lived, it is difficult to detect it. the experimental physicists at lhc, essentially a 27-km tunnel, 175m deep underground along the french-swiss border, are trying to simulate conditions just after the bing bang in this tunnel, in the hope of seeing the higgs bosons. in december last year, cern had revealed that results from their experiments had "tantalising hints" as to the evidence of the higgs boson, but that more data and research was needed to confirm its presence. how important is the discovery rarely are many of us excited about fundamental questions about the universe. however, the higgs boson, perhaps because of its catchier nickname-god's particle-has created an unprecedented buzz among laymen. so is this a finding as great as albert einstein's theory of relativity or quantum mechanics? the question garners mixed response from eminent scientists. famous british particle physicist tom kibble, who is professor of theoretical physics at imperial college in the uk, says, "this would be a major discovery and an important milestone for the development of our theory of fundamental physics. but i would not rank it on the same level as the discovery of relativity or quantum mechanics." mark wise, theoretical physicist at caltech, agrees. "the theory of relativity or newton's law were paradigm shifts. this is unlikely to be that so i wouldn't put it in that league," he says. scientists who are more closely involved with the experiment at cern take a different view. university of california-davis theorist john gunion, who played a key role in designing the multi-million dollar detectors at lhc that would catch the glimpse of the boson, says, "yes, it is of the same rank. discovery of the higgs boson confirms the mechanism by which all elementary particles (such as the electron and the quarks) acquire mass. without mass the universe would not have formed, there would be no life, there would be no electronics, etc. it would not have been possible to formulate the theory of relativity!" john hopkins professor andrei gristan, an experimental physicist closely associated with the cms experiment at cern, says, "such a discovery would be in the same league with some of the most fundamental and important discoveries of the past century. there was probably none like this in the 21st century yet." but while a new particle has been confirmed, it will take time to establish that its characteristics are similar to the higgs boson. cern said current results are preliminary, and more data analysis is needed to confirm it's the boson. web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically. lines and paragraphs break automatically. web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically. lines and paragraphs break automatically. use

C	geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations from scientists, the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer , director of the european center for nuclear research ( cern ), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton 's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela , head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti , head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say. but he told the audience that the discovery of something that appears to be so close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found. we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story," he said. "now, we're way out on the edge of exploration."

"these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe." joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." cern's director general rolph heuer said: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it." addressing the scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer asked: "would you agree?" they burst into applause. peter higgs , the 83-year-old british physicist who proposed the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s, was at cern to welcome the news. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes brimming, he told the symposium: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model. it could also be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva and london to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn.

"these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe." joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." cern's director general rolph heuer said: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it." addressing the scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer asked: "would you agree?" they burst into applause. peter higgs , the 83-year-old british physicist who proposed the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s, was at cern to welcome the news. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes brimming, he told the symposium: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model. it could also be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva and london to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn. "we still much we don't know about particles - this is only the beginning of a new journey. we have closed one chapter and opened another," peter knight of britain's institute of physics said. oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters: "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. "but we can't yet say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." higgs called it a great achievement for the large hadron collider , the 27-km (17-mile) long particle accelerator built in a tunnel underneath the french-swiss border where experiments to search for the higgs boson have taken place. in a statement, he added: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge."

C	, melbourne, july 4 aap july 04 2012, 7:52pm scientists believe they have found the long sought-after "god particle" that shapes the universe, a discovery one excited physicist compared to columbus discovering america. teams of physicists from around the world believe they may have found proof of the theoretical higgs boson that confers mass, the key missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle that determines why nature is the way it is. they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson, the european organisation for nuclear research, or cern, announced in geneva and melbourne on wednesday. while the teams involved in the experiments at the $10 billion large hadron collider particle accelerator near geneva stressed that the results were preliminary, physicists could barely contain their excitement. "a new particle has been discovered that looks like the higgs boson and the dice are now loaded in favour of a discovery," said the university of liverpool's head of particle physics, professor themis bowcock. "based on the cern results alone there appears to be less than one chance in a million that this is fake, which is roughly the same probability as flipping a coin heads-up 21 times in a row," prof bowcock said. "very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle." the discovery of the higgs boson, half a century after it was first proposed, represented a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature, he said. "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." the experiment's teams are not yet sure if the particle is the long sought-after higgs boson or something more "exotic". the next step would be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe, cern said, adding that would take considerable time and data. still, cern director general rolf heuer said it was a milestone and pinning down the new particle's properties would shed light on other mysteries of the universe. "as a layman, i think we have it, but as a scientist i have to say, 'what do we have?'" he said. "i think we have a success today. "we have a discovery, we have discovered a new particle, most probably a higgs boson." the higgs boson is the key missing piece of the rule book of how elementary particles and forces interact in the universe. that standard model of particle physics describes the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them, cern says. "all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about four per cent of the total. "a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96 per cent of the universe that remains obscure." a spokesman for one of two teams involved in the experiment said the preliminary results were dramatic. "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found," cms experiment spokesman joe incandela said. prof bowcock said the modern understanding of physics relied on the existence of the higgs boson, which interacted with other particles, making some very heavy while leaving others light, shaping the universe as we know it. "for the last 40 years it has allowed us to understand phenomena such as light, the way the sun burns, and how atoms and nuclei are held together. without the higgs there would be no stars and ultimately no life." there's talk that the man who first theorised the existence of the god particle in the 1960s, british physicist peter higgs, may receive a nobel prize if it has, in fact, been found. july 04, 2012 8:08 pm aest portfolio / watchlist track all your assets and manage your investments easily. enewsletter keep up to date with the market subscribe to our

C	26/11 control room not possible without state support: pc conspiracy by political rivals: chavan on adarsh charge sheet tweet in a 'quantum' leap in physics, scientists today claimed to have spotted a sub-atomic particle "consistent" with the higgs boson or 'god particle', believed to be a crucial building block that led to the formation of the universe. scientists at switzerland's cern research centre made the historic announcement, in a major milestone in the 50-year search for the elusive higgs, that is believed to have been responsible for lending mass to the particles that eventually formed the stars and the planets after the big bang 13.7 billion years ago. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. joe incandela, the leader of cms, one of the two teams at the world's biggest atom smasher, told a packed audience of scientists at the european centre for nuclear research (cern) that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a "discovery". but he did not yet confirm that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. a second team of physicists atlas also claimed they have observed a new particle, probably the elusive higgs boson. "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev," said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, "but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication". a five sigma, that translates into over 99 per cent certainty of discovery, is required before a particle is declared as being discovered. plus, the higgs is believed to lurk at the lower ends of the energy spectrum -- between 120 and 140 gev. the particle was hypothesized in 1964 by six physicists, including briton peter higgs, whose name it came to bear. the announcements today was made to huge applause by scientists including higgs. higgs said in a statement said: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." cern said the particle they found at lhc is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," but more data was needed to identify the find. boson, on the other hand, is derived from the surname of indian physicist, satyendra nath bose, a contemporary of albert einstein. bose's work on quantum mechanics was adopted by einstein, who extended it to the concept of the bose-einstein condensate -- a dense collection of bosons, sub-atomic particles with integer spin. for 50 years, finding the missing higgs was one of the most puzzling riddles of quantum physics, and led scientists to set up the 3 billion euros large hadron collider, the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. the 27-km looped pipe set up in a tunnel 100 metres underground on the switzerland-france border created artificially simulated conditions similar to the big bang, triggering collisions between accelerated particles. in the lhc experiment, two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions to smash millions of particles into each other every second, a set up that recreats conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the big bang. this is the time when the higgs field is believed to have come into play. the higgs particles are believed to have transferred mass to the millions of other particles in the process of creation of the universe. the scientists then look into conditions that might point to the existence of the mysterious particle. as the higgs cannot be seen, its existence is only to be inferred from circumstances. the standard model -- a hypothesis devised in the 1970s to explain the events after the big bang -- identifies the building blocks for matter. finding the higgs particle would validate the standard model that is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. without the higgs boson, the universe could not exist, as everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else, the scientists believe. cern's data was kept closely guarded but just before the official announcement a video from the cern centre that mistakenly found its way on the web, appeared to have given away the secret.

T	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind - yahoo!7
C	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind geneva (afp) - after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp.

"as a layman, i would say that i think we have it. do you agree?" said rolf dieter heuer, the director general of cern, at the end of the two presentations by scientists working on the large hadron collider. the rapturous applause that met his hypothetical question said it all. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle consistent with a higgs boson?but which one, it remains open," dr heuer said. further work would be necessary to elucidate the precise characteristics of the new sub-atomic particle, he said. discovering the higgs boson would be one of the greatest milestones in science given that the sub-atomic particle can explain why some particles have mass, but others, such as photons of light, do not. theoretical physicists believe that higgs particles permeate the universe creating an invisible force field that causes other particles of matter to have mass. one physicist famously called it the "god particle" because of its central role in theoretical physics - although professor higgs and his younger colleagues at cern despise the term and its religious undertones. joe incandela of cerns's cms experiment explained the technical details that led his team to the conclusion that the higgs may have been sighted. "we are seeing something and it is relatively significant?we have a new boson," he said with the understatement of a scientist working to confidence levels of greater than 99.999 per cent. fabiola gianotti of the atlas experiment at cern echoed the conclusions of her colleagues working on the cms saying that the data show a clear blip around the 125.5 gev range, which is consistent with the standard model prediction of what the higgs should look like. "it would be very nice for the standard model for the higgs to be at that mass. we all have to be proud of these results. they open a door to a very bright future," she concluded at the end of her presentation. professor john womersley, chief executive of science and technology facilities research council, which channels uk funds to cern, said he was delighted with the discovery of a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. "these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe," professor womersley said. "obviously having found a new particle, there is still much, much more to do at the lhc - we need to confirm that this new particle is the reason some particles have tangible mass while others are insubstantial," he said. david willetts, the science minister, said: "our researchers, universities and industry partners have been instrumental in making the large hadron collider such a success. they deserve recognition for their contribution to this scientific milestone that will change the way we look at the universe from now on. and of course professor higgs of edinburgh university has now secured his place in history." professor peter higgs of the university of edinburgh has welcomed results from cern today that give the strongest evidence yet of the existence of the higgs boson, a theoretical physical particle that was first postulated by prof higgs in the 1960s: "scientists at cern are to be congratulated on today's results, which are a great achievement for the large hadron collider and other experiments leading up to this. "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place.

C	geneva: scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe.

T	'god particle': new particle found, could be the higgs boson, cern scientists say - the times of india
C	share and discuss tweet evidence of 'god particle' found: cern see photo geneva/london: scientists at the cern research centre have discovered a new subatomic particle that could be the elusive higgs boson, which is believed to be crucial in the formation of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of the uk's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london . joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and even life. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists don't yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model, a variant of the higgs or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. /div>

T	god particle video leaked to website - world - dna
C	published: wednesday, jul 4, 2012, 16:06 ist agency: ani the cern physics laboratory near geneva appeared to have leaked crucial details of its hunt for the long-sought higgs boson - 'god particle' on tuesday when it accidentally posted a video announcing the discovery of a new particle on its website. senior scientists at cern are due to reveal the latest findings in their hunt for the famed particle at a much-anticipated press conference in geneva on wednesday, and had tried to keep the results under wraps, despite intense rumours that the laboratory had found the particle. but cern, which takes credit for inventing the world wide web, inadvertently released a video interview on its website dated 4 july 2012 in which spokesman joe incandela states the lab has "observed a new particle". a press officer at the laboratory blamed a technical glitch for the video going live. the interview was taken down shortly after. speaking on the video, incandela stopped short of claiming the particle was the higgs boson, saying more work was needed to be sure. "we have quite strong evidence that there's something there. it's properties are still going to take us a little bit of time," the guardian quoted him as saying. the details incandela revealed suggest it has the hallmarks of the higgs particle. "we can see that it decays into two photons, for example, which tells us it's a boson, it's a particle with integer spin, and we know its mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the proton. and this is very significant," incandela said. "this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all this, which i think we will "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks," he said. a spokesperson for cern said that the video went live on the internet due to a "technical fault". they added that the lab had recorded several videos in advance with spokespersons at the lab two teams of physicists at cern are preparing to announce their latest efforts to discover the higgs boson at a press conference at the laboratory on wednesday morning.

T	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , near geneva, home of the large hadron collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simplest proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: "this is sensational news and quite brilliant science. without doubt, cern has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level. i have waited over 20 years for this moment and am thrilled by the news. the excitement will continue now, as we all try to figure out just how this thing behaves." john ellis, who has worked at cern since the 1970s, said the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0.

C	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle this painting shows how a higgs boson may look. scientists at cern plan to make an announcement on wednesday about their hunt for the elusive sub-atomic particle. (ap photo/anja niedringhaus) associated press geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations from scientists, the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say. but he told the audience that the discovery of something that appears to be so close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found. we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story," he said.

C	after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists have said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) on wednesday after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle back in 1964, expressed joy. standard model "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. mathematical quirk over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp news agency.

T	new discovery could be 'god particle' - science - canoe.ca
C	geneva/london - scientists at the cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of britain's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and even life. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists don't yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model, a variant of the higgs or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. the higgs particle - what it is and what it does scientists at the cern research centre near geneva, switzerland, on wednesday unveiled their latest findings in their search for the higgs boson, a subatomic particle key to the formation of stars, planets and eventually life after the big bang 13.7 billion years ago. what is the higgs boson? the higgs is the last missing piece of the standard model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found and finding the higgs would validate the model. ruling it out or finding something more exotic would force a rethink on how the universe is put together. scientists believe that in the first billionth of a second after the big bang, the universe was a gigantic soup of particles racing around at the speed of light without any mass to speak of. it was through their interaction with the higgs field that they gained mass and eventually formed the universe. the higgs field is a theoretical and invisible energy field that pervades the whole cosmos. some particles, like the photons that make up light, are not affected by it and therefore have no mass. others find it drags on them as porridge drags on a spoon. picture george clooney (the particle) walking down a street with a gaggle of photographers (the higgs field) clustered around him. an average guy on the same street (a photon) gets no attention from the paparazzi and gets on with his day. the higgs particle is the signature of the field - an eyelash of one of the photographers. the particle is theoretical, first posited in 1964 by six physicists, including briton peter higgs. the search for it only began in earnest in the 1980s, first in fermilab's now mothballed tevatron particle collider near chicago and later in a similar machine at cern, but most intensively since 2010 with the start-up of the european centre's large hadron collider. what is the standard model? the standard model is to physics what the theory of evolution is to biology. it is the best explanation physicists have of how the building blocks of the universe are put together. it describes 12 fundamental particles, governed by four basic forces. but the universe is a big place and the standard model only explains a small part of it. scientists have spotted a gap between what we can see and what must be out there. that gap must be filled by something we don't fully understand, which they have dubbed 'dark matter'. galaxies are also hurtling away from each other faster than the forces we know about suggest they should. this gap is filled by 'dark energy'. this poorly understood pair are believed to make up a whopping 96 percent of the mass and energy of the cosmos. confirming the standard model, or perhaps modifying it, would be a step towards the holy grail of physics - a 'theory of everything' that encompasses dark matter, dark energy and the force of gravity, which the standard model also does not explain. it could also shed light on even more esoteric ideas, such as the possibility of parallel universes. cern spokesman james gillies has said that just as albert einstein's theories enveloped and built on the work of isaac newton, the work being done by the thousands of physicists at cern has the potential to do the same to einstein's work. what is the large hadron collider? the large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator, a 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe that sits in a tunnel 100 metres underground on the swiss/french border. it cost 3 billion euros to build. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around it before smashing into each other to create many millions of particle collisions every second in a recreation of the conditions a fraction of a second after the big bang, when the higgs field is believed to have 'switched on'. the vast amount of data produced is examined by banks of computers. of all the trillions of collisions, very few are just right for revealing the higgs particle. that makes the hunt for the higgs slow, and progress incremental. what is the threshold for proof? to claim a discovery, scientists have set themselves a target for certainty that they call "5 sigma". this means that there is a probability of less than one in a million that their conclusions from the data harvested from the particle accelerator are the result of a statistical fluke.

C	ice cream used as excuse in crash a woman accused of leaving the scene of a minor traffic crash ? 'god particle' may have been found the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new? netflix says its subscribers watched more than 1 billion hours ? it seems like a dream as flighty as tinkerbell and as quirky as? eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle scientists may have found 'god particle' updated: wednesday, 04 jul 2012, 6:38 am edt published : wednesday, 04 jul 2012, 6:38 am edt geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations from scientists, the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say. but he told the audience that the discovery of something that appears to be so close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed.

C	cern spots higgs-like particle, now let the head scratching begin physicists working at the large hadron collider (lhc) at cern, geneva, announced via a live two-way video link to the international conference on high energy physics (ichep) in melbourne, the result is the most significant finding in particle physics for decades and is potentially capable of solving a long-standing mystery concerning the origin of mass. all matter in the universe is ultimately composed of subatomic particles, and the hugely successful standard model of particle physics mathematically describes what these particles are and how they interact. the physicists of the 1960s knew most of the details, but found that any attempt to give particles a non-zero mass broke the theory. as any personal trainer will tell you, mass is a fact of life, and it was not long before a handful of physicists developed an elegant solution: if the universe is filled with a particular quantum field, particles can interact with it to gain mass. one way to envision this is to consider a small ant -- it has little or no intrinsic mass and may thus be called massless; however, should this ant walk through some treacle, it feels a great inertia from its interaction with it. our particles have the same experience, except that some of them feel the treacle more strongly than others and are hence heavier. this "background of particle treacle" was christened "the higgs field" after peter higgs, a key proponent of the idea, and experimental physicists commenced a 50-year journey to obtain conclusive evidence of the field's existence. by smashing particles together at high energy in giant colliders, scientists aimed to produce a particle associated with the field known as the higgs boson, recognisable through the particular pattern of signals it would induce in giant detectors buried deep underground. the quest for the higgs boson has involved decades of hard labour from thousands of physicists, engineers, and computer scientists, and is the last piece of the puzzle required to complete the standard model. that quest may now be over. two experiments at the lhc at cern, geneva, have seen strong enough evidence for a higgs-like particle to declare a formal discovery of something new and both are seeing similar signals. produced in the collision of high energy protons at the foot of the jura mountains, the new particle has a mass of roughly 125 "gigaelectronvolts" and has been seen to decay into a variety of other particles, with the pattern of these decay products being broadly consistent with the precisely calculated signatures of the higgs. physicists worldwide have greeted the news with a mixture of excitement, delight, astonishment and, most typically for the most sceptical profession on earth, a good deal of head-scratching. is the new particle really the boson predicted by the standard model, or is it a yet more exotic version? martial trezzini/epa theoretical physicists have worked for years on theories that may one day supercede the standard model, and many of these theories predict more than one higgs boson or a higgs boson that would decay differently. the lhc has not yet produced enough higgs bosons to definitely answer these questions, but the precision of the measurements will increase over the year as the lhc collects more data. for now, many are speculating that the particle may indeed be an exotic higgs rather than the common garden variety -- a result that would be as popular as it would be earth-shattering. as the champagne glasses are cleared from the tables of the melbourne exhibition centre, those not lucky enough to attend ichep are watching melbourne, where the details of the new results will be presented and discussed this weekend. this international focus on melbourne occurs at a time when australian particle physics is enjoying a significant increase in funding thanks to the creation of a new australian research council centre of excellence in particle physics, home to many physicists - including this author. today's google doodle celebrates aussie ruby payne-scott fire chaser beetles sense flames from hundreds of kilometres away science proves men really are attracted to psychologically vulnerable women neil armstrong talks moon landing to australian accountants did a car company just make the best password manager we've seen? ios 6 will now prevent apps from stealing your contact data top 10 pervasive tech myths that are only wasting your time shooting challenge: gizmodo logo?win an olympus om-d em-5 dslr camera! samsung galaxy s iii review: one x marks the spot upgrading to windows 8 will only cost you $40

T	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind | the raw story
C	after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the elusive higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation erupted at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented astonishing new data in their search for the mysterious particle. many hailed it as a moment in history, and white-haired veterans of the quest shed tears of joy. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. he and others cautioned, though, that further work was needed to identify what exactly had been found. "as a layman i would say we have it, but as a scientist i have to say, 'what do we have?'" heuer told a press conference. "we have discovered a boson, and now we have to determine what kind of boson it is." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who in 1964 published the conceptual groundwork for the particle and whose name became associated with it, expressed delight. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," the 83-year-old said in a statement. higgs sat next to belgian physicist francois englert, 79, who separately contributed to the theory. "i just want to say that my thoughts go to robert brout," said englert, his eyes moist with tears, as he lauded a fellow pioneer who died in 2011 before the once-outlandish theory could be proved. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. the higgs has been dubbed the "god particle" because it is powerful and ubiquitous yet so hard to find. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." at a particle-physics conference in melbourne, australia, a participant said there was a "jaw-dropping" moment when the scientists reacted to the announcement. scientists began to pore over what the find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. "it may be the higgs boson, but it may also be something far bigger, which opens the door towards a new theory that goes beyond the standard model." about raw story raw story is a progressive news site that focuses on stories often ignored in the mainstream media. while giving coverage to the big stories of the day, we also bring our readers' attention to policy, politics, legal and human rights stories that get ignored in an infotainment culture driven solely by pageviews. founded in cambridge, ma in 2004, raw story reaches more than 2.7 million unique readers per month and serves more than 11.4 million pageviews. recent focal points have included occupy wall street, wikileaks, wiretapping and judicial abuse.

T	discovery of the 'god particle': what does it mean? - urban christian news
C	the british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern's headquarters on wednesday. (pool photo by denis balibouse) physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant.it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond -- everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson -- and there are hints of some already -- could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story -- more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email, "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." click here to read more. source: the new york times dennis overbye

T	cern data points to new particle that could be 'higgs boson' but further science needed to confirm finding | video | theblaze.com
C	(image: cern) geneva (the blaze/ap) - scientists at the world's largest atom smasher on wednesday had an announcement. the long-sought-after "god particle" - more scientifically known as the higgs boson - has been found*. (related: did physicists really find the god particle this time?) *by found, the scientists at the european center for nuclear research (cern) mean their data has shown a new particle that is "consistent" with the what they would expect of the higgs boson. so why not come right out and say they've officially found the particle they believe will help explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape? statement that it is "hard not to get excited by these results" but, as the cms experiment spokesperson puts it, the " implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." watch this reuters report where scientists call this a "very, very preliminary result": cern director rolf heuer told scientists who received the announcement with applause that what researchers have found is a missing "cornerstone." he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." check out this slideshow showing pictures from the announcement event: the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to our understanding of why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists know what a boson is and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, `"what do we have?' " the leaders of the two teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s. that was part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, higgs said he also could not yet say. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found."

T	higgs boson found: scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' | mail online
C	scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' discovery of particle is most important in physics in decades leading physicists watch announcement at cern in switzerland end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle last jigsaw piece that proves our view of universe is right 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass audience includes professor peter higgs who suggested boson's existence prof higgs, 83: 'i had no idea this would happen in my lifetime' by rob waugh published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 05:57 est, 4 july 2012 comments ( 114 ) share the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that holds the universe together - is over. scientists at switzerland's cern (the european council for nuclear research) announced the discovery of the particle to an audience including professor peter higgs, who first suggested the existence of the particle four decades ago. the discovery is the biggest leap in physics for decades - filling in a crucial gap in our understanding of the atom. in the long term, the discovery could lead to new technologies. professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, said: 'they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science.' professor higgs, who first postulated the particle nearly 50 years ago, was at the announcement. he wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were announced, and later said: 'it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.' scroll down for live video joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, announces the discovery of a particle that corresponds to theories of the higgs boson at cern today the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle why the higgs matters - what the new particle means the existence of the higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. the higgs is the last missing piece of the standard model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the higgs is the last jigsaw piece. if the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the big bang, an invisible force known as the higgs field formed. this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles - or higgs bosons.as other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the higgs boson will be long term, but they could be in fields as diverse as medicine, computing and manufacturing. experts compare the search for the higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. the idea of the electron - a subatomic particle - was first floated in 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patients. 'this is indeed a new particle,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. the discovery fills in the last gap in the 'standard model' of physics - proving einstein right, and possibly leading to new technologies built on our understanding of the particle. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. more... 'britain's atlantis' found at bottom of north sea - a huge undersea kingdom swallowed by the sea in 6500bc a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' is the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. 'we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev,' said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, 'but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.' 'the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,' said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. 'the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.' 'it's hard not to get excited by these results,' said cern research director sergio bertolucci. ' we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point.' prof higgs, who first postulated the theory more than 40 years ago, told the bbc: 'i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. 'i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them.' british physicist peter higgs (right) is welcomed by european organization for nuclear research (cern) director-general rolf-dieter heuer (left) british physicist peter higgs arrives for the conference near geneva inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider the 'god particle' - why the higgs hunt caused controversy the search for the particle caused controversy as members of the public feared that the high-energy collisions could cause a black hole or an interdimensional gateway in switzerland. religious groups also objected to the use of the term 'god particle' - although cern's scientists dislike the term just as much. nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman nicknamed the boson the 'god particle' in 1993 - which makes it popular in the media but has angered many scientists, including professor higgs himself. at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. physicists needed the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a model of the large hadron collider (lhc) tunnel is seen in the cern (european organization for nuclear research) visitors' center a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.' cern announcement live video: prof higgs makes rare public appearance at press conference

T	new subatomic particle could be higgs boson | global indigo
C	after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists have said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) on wednesday after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle back in 1964, expressed joy. standard model "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. mathematical quirk over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp news agency. "it may be the higgs boson, but it may also be something far bigger, which opens the door towards a new theory that goes beyond the standard model." 654 source

T	particle discovery may help scientists understand mass - bloomberg
C	discovered a particle that may support a decades-old theory of physics, bringing people closer to understanding unseen parts of the universe. the observed particle is the heaviest boson ever found, said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the experiments at cern, the european organization for nuclear research, at a seminar today at its geneva headquarters. scientists stopped short of claiming the particle is the elusive higgs boson , a theoretical particle that could explain where mass comes from. "as a layman, i think i would say 'we have it,'" said rolf-dieter heuer, director of cern, at a press conference in geneva. it will take at least three to four years of research to fully understand the properties of the observed particle, heuer said. the announcement brings humankind closer to answering a millennia-old question that the ancient greeks wrestled with: what is matter made of? the particle is a key to the standard model , a theory explaining how the universe is built, and its existence would help scientists gain a better understanding of how galaxies hold together. it also could open a door to exploring other parts of physics such as superparticles or dark matter that telescopes can't detect. 'sings and dances' the new boson "sings and dances like" the theoretical particle, said pauline gagnon, a researcher on the atlas set of experiments in geneva, in an interview in melbourne, where she was attending the bi-annual international conference on high energy physics . "there is no doubt it comes from a different signal, different channels, with different experiments. we just need in the next few months with more data to ascertain exactly what are the properties of this particle to see if it is exactly the standard model higgs boson or some variation of it."" particle physics is the study of the elemental building blocks that make up matter. these particles, with names such as quark, fermion, lepton and boson, can't be subdivided. they exist and interact within several unseen ''fields'' that permeate the universe. the field that generates mass for objects is named for u.k. physicist peter higgs, who in the 1960s was one of the first scientists to outline a working theory on how elemental particles achieve mass. higgs was one of four of the theorists attending today's meeting in geneva. he wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were presented. champagne for higgs ''for me, it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," higgs said in geneva. in a statement, he said he would be "asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." higgs wrote that some particles -- such as photons, the basic unit of light -- don't interact with the higgs field, and thus don't achieve mass. most others do. to put it another way, if the higgs field were a hollywood party, a photon would be the unknown actor who hurries through without gaining a bit of interest from others in the room. other particles would be more like angelina jolie , drawing crowds of hangers-on as they move through the party. it gets increasingly harder to stop such a cluster from moving forward and more difficult to get it moving again once it's stopped, meeting one definition of mass. scientists are trying to prove the existence of the higgs field by displaying a physical effect for the higgs boson, a particle that lives for less than a trillionth of a second and is an excitation, or force, within the higgs field. digging deeper providing indirect evidence that the higgs field exists will allow scientists to dig even deeper into the secrets of our existence, said mark wise, a professor of physics at california institute of technology . "in some sense, this is the beginning," wise said of finding the boson. "because we want to know all its properties." the data being presented today are the latest from the $10.5 billion large hadron collider, a 27-kilometer (17-mile) circumference particle accelerator buried on the border of france and switzerland . cern has 10,000 scientists working on the project, in which billions of subatomic particles are hurled at each other at velocities approaching the speed of light. the collider will provide more data later this year, giving scientists a more complete picture of the observed new particle. researchers will try to determine whether it is a higgs boson, the particle predicted by the standard model. like columbus "very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle," said themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool , said in a statement. "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." a more exotic version of the higgs particle could help scientists understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains obscure, since observable matter only represents 4 percent of the total, cern said. to declare the boson is discovered, physicists use the statistical standard of "five sigma," meaning that there should only be a 1 in 3.4 million chance that a sighting would be due to chance. the observations of the new particle have a five-sigma level of significance, incandela said. "the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks," he said. to contact the reporters on this story: thomas mulier in geneva at particle discovery brings scientists close to understanding mass a graphic showing a collision of particles at the compact muon solenoid experience, at cern, in geneva, on december 13, 2011. particle discovery brings scientists close to understanding mass spokesman for one of the experiments at cern joe incandela, right, gestures next to cern director rolf-dieter heuer at a press conference in meyrin near geneva. u.k. physicist peter higgs said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime."

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle | world news | the guardian
C	john heilprin associated press= geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. japanese visitors to scotland told eat, drink but be wary (of calling locals english) india's 'child picasso' puts on his goggles and takes aim at the canvas antidote by oliver burkeman ?9.99

"if the higgs observation is confirmed...this really will be one of the discoveries of the century," said themis bowcock, a professor of particle physics at britain's liverpool university. "physicists will have uncovered a keystone in the makeup of the universe...whose influence we see and feel every day of our lives." the leaders of two experiments, altas and cms, revealed their findings to a packed seminar at cern, where they have tried to find traces of the elusive boson by smashing particles together in the large hadron collider at high speed. "both experiments have the signals pointing in essentially the same direction," said oliver buchmueller, senior physicist on cms. "it seems that both atlas and us have found the signals are at the same mass level. that is obviously very important." fabiola gianotti, the scientist in charge of the atlas experiment, said altas had narrowed the search to a signal centred at around 126 gev (giga electron volts), which would be compatible with the expected strength of a standard model higgs.

"this video was released due to a technical glitch on our side here at cern. the final results have not yet been released," cern press officer renilde vanden broeck said in melbourne. she said the organization had prepared several videos for a range of outcomes for wednesday's announcement. a cern physicist who knows what will be announced said the discovery was not necessarily definitive.

primary objective of the lhc is to either discover or dispute the so-called higgs boson. the higgs boson was first hypothesized nearly 50 years ago in 1964 in order to find a mechanism by which all particles that make up the matter in our universe acquire mass. just in the last year the lhc has made significant progress in its search for the higgs boson. particularly at the end of 2011 initial

the existence of a new particle, the higgs boson (often described as "the most sought-after particle in modern physics"). although this particle has not turned up in accelerator experiments so far, the higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important ingredient in the prof. higgs has been honoured with a number of awards in recognition of his work, including the 1997 dirac medal and prize for outstanding contributions to theoretical physics from the north tyneside, england. his father worked as a sound engineer for the bbc, and as a result of childhood asthma, together with the family moving around because of his father's job, and later the second world war , higgs missed some early schooling and was taught at home. when his father relocated to university of edinburgh. in 2008 he received an honorary fellowship from swansea university for his work in particle physics. work in theoretical physics at edinburgh higgs first became interested in mass , developing the idea that particles were massless when the universe began, acquiring mass a fraction of a second later as a result of interacting with a theoretical field (which became known as the higgs field ). higgs postulated that this field permeates space, giving all elementary subatomic particles that interact with it their mass. while the higgs field is postulated to confer mass on quarks and leptons, it causes only a tiny portion of the masses of other subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons. in these, gluons that bind quarks together confer most of the particle mass. superconductivity in condensed matter. however, the theory predicted massless particles (the higgs wrote a short paper exploiting a loophole in goldstone's theorem and published it in switzerland, in 1964. higgs wrote a second paper describing a theoretical model (now called the higgs mechanism ) but the paper was rejected (the editors of physics letters judged it "of no obvious relevance to physics"). higgs wrote an extra paragraph and sent his paper to tom kibble had reached the same conclusion independently about the same time. the three papers written on this boson discovery by higgs, guralnik, hagen, kibble, brout, and englert were each recognized as milestone papers by physical review letters 50th anniversary celebration. while each of these famous papers took similar approaches, the contributions and differences between the philip anderson also claims to have "invented" the "higgs" boson as far back as 1962. , higgs is reported to be displeased that the particle is nicknamed the "god particle". higgs is afraid the term "might offend people who are religious". this nickname for the higgs boson is usually attributed to leon lederman , but it is actually the result of lederman's publisher's censoring. originally lederman intended to call it "the goddamn particle", because of its elusiveness. in december 2011 cern reported that two independent experiments at the large hadron collider had seen "tantalising hints" of the existence of the higgs boson. if the higgs boson is found at cern, higgs and the others who contributed to the brout-englert-higgs-guralnik-hagen-kibble mechanism may receive a cnd activist while in london and later in edinburgh, but resigned his membership when the group extended its remit from campaigning against nuclear weapons to campaigning against nuclear power too. he was a greenpeace member until the group opposed genetically modified organisms. wolf prize in physics (sharing it with brout and englert), but he refused to fly to jerusalem to receive

C	watch: eureka! physicists claim they've discovered the 'god particle' to cheers and standing ovations from scientists, the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say. but he told the audience that the discovery of something that appears to be so close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found. we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story," he said. "now, we're way out on the edge of exploration."

"i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of britain's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and even life. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists don't yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model, a variant of the higgs or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. your comment must be approved by a moderator before being published on jpost.com. disqus users can post comments automatically.

T	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind < swiss news | expatica switzerland
C	04/07/2012higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. join expatica's online community to reach out for expats just like you! switzerland's healthcare system information about the swiss healthcare system, health insurance, pharmacies and emergency numbers.

T	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , near geneva, home of the large hadron collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simplest proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: "this is sensational news and quite brilliant science. without doubt, cern has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level. i have waited over 20 years for this moment and am thrilled by the news. the excitement will continue now, as we all try to figure out just how this thing behaves." john ellis, who has worked at cern since the 1970s, said the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. "now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? "the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter." "we're not certain, but i'd be willing to bet the house this turns out to be some sort of higgs particle," said joe incandela, spokesperson for the cms collaboration. higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle higgs boson: us physicists find strongest evidence yet of 'god particle' why the higgs particle hunt was always going to be a waiting game strong hints of the higgs boson from tevatron particle collider in us higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle #higgs working group can now be subsumed into the standard model group quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

T	higgs boson 'discovered', existence of mass in universe explained by 'god particle' - forbes
C	cern in switzerland have confirmed the existence of the elusive higgs boson-or something very much like it. "the cms experiments at cern today presented their latest results in the search for the long-sought higgs boson . both experiments see strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (gev)," cern has announced on their homepage. "the experiments found hints of the new particle by analysing trillions of proton-proton collisions from the standard model of particle physics predicts that a higgs boson would decay into different particles - which the lhc experiments then detect." atlas and cms have characterized "the level of significance of the result as 5 sigma on the scale that particle physicists use to describe the certainty of a discovery. one sigma means the results could be random fluctuations in the data, 3 sigma counts as an observation and a 5-sigma result is a discovery." business practitioners of 6 sigma methodology will see that this is (really) close to certainty, but no cigar quite yet. for half a century, physicists have had this problem. the standard model , developed in the 1960s, so elegantly describes so many aspects of the physical universe-but it leaves out 96% of the mass. big problem. so it has been job #1 to find the missing mass-to describe a mechanism by which particles acquire mass. at higher and higher levels of energy, the different forces of the universe-gravity, electromagnetism, the weak and strong forces-unify like in the first instants after the big bang, and it is possible to "see" phenomena that are too volatile to observe in everyday life. the standard model predicts that one of those volatile things is the higgs boson, a particle (or class of particles) that are "gobbled up" by other particles, giving them mass. [note: massive oversimplification! ] the pursuit of the missing mass, and the elusive bosons, has been accomplished with the use of higher and higher-powered particle accelerators, all the way up to the present lhc at cern. in its first year of operation, it would seem that the lhc has succeeded at manifesting a particle that has the characteristics of the higgs. years of study are ahead for scientists at cern to confirm exactly what they have seen. is it the "simple" higgs predicted by the model, or something more exotic that points to other avenues of research? for the moment, its discovery does firm up what we know about mass in physics, which is a big deal. in the video (above) just released by cern, theoretical physicist john ellis explains the concept of the higgs field, "empty space is like a medium, and as particles travel through this medium, some of them interact with it, some of them don't interact with it. the ones that do interact with this medium, they acquire masses. the ones that pass through without interacting, those are our massless particles." ellis compares this to an endless field of snow, with different particles either gliding on the top (like fast, "massless" skiers) or sinking down into it (like a person walking in deep powder). philip tanedo provides technical but lucid explanations of all of this (complete with user-friendly diagrams) at his wonderful why we expect a higgs boson." why does this matter? because this hierarchical asymmetry of particles that is explained by the existence of the higgs field is something we do, indeed, experience in everyday life. look at the power law distribution of wealth, ideas or popularity in society and you will see the same mechanisms at play. some entities-from people to products, companies to concepts-acquire mass, influence and prestige while other go unnoticed. these "massive particles" emit lot of light (i.e.: buzz) social media, twitter in particular, has been really useful in making this process concrete, and companies like klout and others have tried to turn this "big data" into usable data-with mixed results. on a more philosophical level-and the reason why the higgs has been known as the "god particle"-it makes a difference to our state of mind believing that most of the mass in the universe is explained as opposed to 96% random. there are still the mysteries of dark matter, dark energy and antimatter to sort out, but a higgs universe is less of a godless anarchy than one without it. a proton-proton collision event in the cms experiment producing two high-energy photons (red towers). this is what we would expect to see from the decay of a higgs boson but it is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. ? cern 2012 i am a content strategist, designer and developer. i use my experience as a magazine art director and web editor to help publishers, marketers, non-profits and self-branded individuals tell their stories in words and images. i follow all of the technologies that relate to the content business and try to identify the opportunities and pitfalls that these technologies pose. at the same time i am immersed in certain sectors through my content practice and am always looking to find connections between the worlds of neurology, economics, entertainment, travel and mobile technology. i live near the appropriately-scaled metropolis of portland, maine, and occasionally write about the creative economy in portland in wingandko.com . the author is a forbes contributor. the opinions expressed are those of the writer. amazon cloud goes down friday night, taking netflix, instagram and pinterest with it will october's iphone 5 look like this? is this how apple dreams become our realities? android payback: apple to cut google out of stunning new 3d maps app in ios6

C	scientists find new particle, probably the higgs by chris wickham and rosalba o'brien | reuters - related content a computer screen is pictured before ? british physicist peter higgs (r) ? article: the higgs particle - what it is and what it does 3 hrs ago geneva/london ( reuters ) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson , the basic building block of the universe . "we have indeed discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson," john womersley, head of a british public research body, told journalists and scientists in london on wednesday. "these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe." joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva : "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." cern's director general rolph heuer said: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it." addressing the scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer asked: "would you agree?" they burst into applause. peter higgs , the 83-year-old british physicist who proposed the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s, was at cern to welcome the news. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes brimming, he told the symposium: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model. it could also be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva and london to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn. "we still much we don't know about particles - this is only the beginning of a new journey. we have closed one chapter and opened another," peter knight of britain's institute of physics told reuters. oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters: "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. "but we can't yet say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." higgs called it a great achievement for the large hadron collider, the 27-km (17-mile) long particle accelerator built in a tunnel underneath the french-swiss border where experiments to search for the higgs boson have taken place. in a statement, he added: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge."

T	physicists show evidence of new subatomic particle seen as key to explaining the universe | fort frances times online
C	physicists show evidence of new subatomic particle seen as key to explaining the universe geneva - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometre (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed.

T	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened - telegraph
C	higgs boson announcement from cern: as it happened higgs boson: an important day for british physics 12.46pm we are wrapping up for today. thanks for joining us and please buy tomorrow's newspaper for all the latest analysis. 12.20pm prof themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, who has worked on the lhc, said: "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle. half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature. 12.10pm things became a little emotional earlier as prof higgs listened to the announcement twitter: simon pegg - was higgs boson where they left it? i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them. 11.57am comedian dara o briain explains @laurenlaverne without higgs everything would just ping around at the speed of light, not interact, and we couldn't, y'know, sit on stuff 11.46am lhc achievement is the equivalent of the discovery of dna and man landing on the moon, claims professor sir peter knight , president of the institute of physics (iop). this is the physics version of the discovery of dna. it sets the course for a brand new adventure in our efforts to understand the fabric of our universe." this is a remarkable achievement. fifteen years of international collaboration and hard work constructing the large hadron collider has paid off. akin to a moon mission, one of the most remarkable things about the hunt for the higgs is how the effort has caught the public imagination. not since the apollo missions 40 years ago has there been such a sense of popular excitement around scientific discovery. long may this continue to inspire the next generation of scientists." peter clarke , professor of physics at the university of edinburgh, provides a helpful analogy to help explain just how important the higgs boson is to the understanding of physics. asked to describe it in layman's terms, he explained: if we were discovering the human body and found a little finger on one hand, after we had already seen five fingers on the other hand, that would be important but not unexpected. it's not really adding much to what we already know. some sorts of particles can be like that - very important but predicted. this is like discovering the heart; without it the entire model of the human body does not work. that is the significance of this particle. he has also explained the higgs mechanism, using the example of trying to push a balloon (representing a massless particle) through a room while wearing a blindfold. if that room were to be filled with treacle, he explained, the balloon would feel heavy. the treacle in this instance is comparable to the higgs mechanism, permanently giving the object mass. prof clarke added he hopes the work of peter higgs work and his colleagues is considered worthy of a nobel prize. "i think many of us have believed for a long time that this work is very close to being deserving of a nobel prize. i hope it's considered worthy." 11.16am controversial question. the panel is asked how they can justify the huge budget in light of the economic crisis around the world. director general rolf heuer replies if there is no fundamental science then there is no basis for applied science. we have to strike a balance. 23 years ago the world wide web was born here. it has changed the world dramatically 11.05am ask a silly question and you get a serious answer. when a journalist asked the scientists what was the best and worst metaphor in relation to the higgs boson, they got a brusque reply from the director general twitter: nick collins - rolf-dieter heuer, dg of cern: "as a layman, i would now say i think we have it. do you agree?" huge applause. #higgs 11.02am professor higgs asked to say a few words at the press conference but he seems slightly irritated at the suggestion. i say this is not the occasion for that discussion. let us continue with the main topic 10.52am tom chivers found this... 10.44am the press association writes: scientists today hailed the "momentous" discovery of what appears to be the "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the fabric of the universe together. teams at the large hadron collider (lhc), the ?2.6 billion atom smashing machine near geneva, say they have found a new sub-atomic particle "consistent" with the higgs boson. the results are preliminary and more work is needed before the scientists can be sure of what "species" of particle they have captured. but observations carried out so far show it looks and acts like the long-sought particle that has eluded them for 50 years from the guardian asks whether the weeks have been emotional? |they have been extremely intense, full of a lot of emotions 10.38am nick collins, the daily telegraph science correspondent, asks whether peter higgs and the cern team deserve a nobel prize. director general rolf heuer replies i don't think my opinion counts but it was great work. 10.19am the press conference opens with a nice gag. cern director general rolf heuer says i think there could be worse days in the life of a director general of cern 10.15am they may know how to find a minute atomic particle but they can't use a microphone. press conference delayed by sound technical difficulties. 10.12 peter higgs has said this is "really the most incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime" twitter: nick collins - the speakers have just arrived and sat down for the press conference and had about 50 cameras shoved in their faces. rock star moment. 10.08am the announcement has been called a "momentous day for science. telegraph reporters ceri perkins , and scientists believe they have captured the elusive "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the physical fabric of the universe together. the historic announcement came in a progress report from the large hadron collider particle accelerator. professor john womersley, chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." scientists say it is a 5 sigma result which means they are 99.999% sure they have found a new particle. twitter: nick collins - "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." twitter: nick collins - standing ovation at cern. dg then turns to video link and asks for applause from ichep crowd in melbourne. #showman 10.00am speaking on bbc radio 4's today programme, scientists explained this could be be "one of the most significant steps" in human understanding of the universe and an "historic day" for physics. professor jim virdee , head of physics at imperial college, said: i suspect it's going to be a historic day. i think it will be one of the most significant steps we have taken in our understanding of how the universe works. calling it the "key missing element" in the understanding of the universe, he said: "finding the higgs boson will actually allow us to understand very deeply what's going on and open up more questions. "it's a portal from 20th century science to 21st century science." he added it could be "a great example" of a discovery that would "change they way we live". professor jon butterworth , head of astronomy and physics at ucl, said: i think it's going to be very exciting. we are really looking over the threshold in physics that we never look over before. he added a potential discovery would "give us clues to answer the other big questions." so after all last night's confusion over the large hadron collider and the higgs boson - have they found it? or have they simply made a series of home videos? - it appears that the elusive particle, or something like it, really has been found. i've been watching the live stream (see our live blog, here), and i have to admit it's several vertical kilometres above my pay grade, but here is what i've managed to glean from it. first, as was hinted yesterday, the cms detector - one of the two major experiments at the large hadron collider - has definitely found something. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the experiment, said they have seen something "very strong, very solid" at the 125gev (gigaelectronvolt) mass, where they had thought they'd seen something in december. the first slide showed a curve of results, with a single bump up at 125gev. "it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks: "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. prof peter higgs, the theorist who first predicted the existence of the higgs boson, has told the guardian that he "shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge" this evening. congratulations are due to everyone involved, it would seem. twitter: tom whipple - professor higgs: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." 9.35am "it's hard not to get excited by these results," adds cern research director sergio bertolucci professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." cern have announced that they have found a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. they are 99.999% sure it is the "god particle" 9.25am good morning on this momentous day. looks like the 50-year search for the elusive higgs boson is almost over. here's some of what we have learnt already. prof james incandela, the spokesman for the cms experiment at the large hadron collider, has announced a "very strong, very solid" finding of a new particle, at a mass of 125gev (gigaelectronvolts), where the experimenters found a hint in december. that is consistent with the predictions for the the higgs boson made by the standard model, the model of elementary physics. now a spokesman for the atlas experiment is speaking. last night, an apparently leaked video hinted that the new particle might have been found. read more in tom chivers's news story here: higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found scottish lecturer found to be 'grandfather of everyone in britain' scientists developing device to 'hack' into brain of stephen hawking higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of "god particle" | al.com
C	view full size geneva - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration."

T	progressive eruptions: cern reporting higgs boson found!
C	"aspen, colo. - physicists working at cern 's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. " --new york times this is an exciting day for science, and especially for theoretical physicists. happy fourth of july to all!
Q	aspen, colo.
Q	i think we have it,
Q	a historic milestone.
Q	higgs-like
Q	it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are,
Q	very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example.

C	arise sir peter: give professor higgs a knighthood, say colleagues professor peter higgs, the british scientist who first suggested the existence of the "god particle", should be knighted and awarded a nobel prize following the discovery of the higgs boson, leading physicists have said. professor higgs, who appeared to wipe away a tear as he listened to today's announcement, has said he had no idea the "amazing" discovery would be made within his lifetime when he made his proposals more than 50 years ago. his colleagues are now calling for him to be honoured with a knighthood or the nobel prize, to commemorate his invaluable contribution to the understanding of the universe. one said he was "amazed" prof higgs had not already been honoured, while another described him as a "real gentleman and a great scientist who is certainly worthy of a knighthood". in 1964, he and five other theoretical physicists - fran?ois englert, robert brout, gerald guralnik, c. r. hagen, and tom kibble - proposed the existence of an invisible field lying across the universe and giving particles their mass. today, scientists from the cern, the european organisation for nuclear research, announced they had discovered a subatomic particle consistent with the higgs boson. rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, said: "i think we have it." physicists across britain have hailed the discovery as a "major breakthrough", a "triumph" and "truly great moment for science". one compared it to columbus discovering of america, while another used the analogy of the human body, saying the higgs boson was of equivalent importance to the heart. many have now called for professor higgs, now 83, to receive a knighthood, and the team who help develop the theory to be awarded the nobel prize. professor jim al-khalili, professor of physics at teh university of surrey, said: "of all the people worthy of a knighthood i cannot think of anyone more deserving right now than peter higgs. "his incredible prediction almost half a century ago of the existence of a new particle that bears his name has turned out to be correct and will surely now revolutionise physics.

T	cern scientists discover higgs-like particle - us messageboards - where the cool kids play!
C	posts: 1,973 thanks given: 243 cern scientists discover higgs-like particle physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. enlarge this image fabrice coffrini/agence france-presse - getty images joe incandela, a cern spokesman, right, gestured next to rolf-dieter heuer, cern's director general, during a press conference at the organization's offices near geneva on wednesday. related "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." back in it's heyday there was an upshoot of particle accelerators. we have one right here in bloomington, indiana. funny thing, no one wanted to be near it, so a developer bought up land nearby and established a very nice condo retirement community called "meadow woods" (1980). i guess enough of us old folks aren't afraid of "radiation" or science. it did a lot for iu's math department. you may not post new threads you may not post replies you may not powered by vbulletin, jelsoft enterprises ltd.

T	conclusions drawn: "god particle" found ("divined," actually)
C	you've probably already seen the headline "god particle found" over the last couple of days. but what does it really mean? "a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson - or the 'god particle,' to the chagrin of scientists - the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe " begins this article in today's los angeles times . but reading further, it becomes clear that the 6,000 cern scientists working on the project didn't actually find this new god particle itself, but rather 'divined its existence' from a 'bump in the data.' "the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there... but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a 'bump' in their data consistent with a higgs boson." maybe its because i'm not a physicist myself that i can't see why this is so different from 6,000 unkempt cryptozoologists 'divining the existence' of bigfoot from only the plaster casts of huge feet, because the creature is elusive and disappears so quickly. the timing of this announcement is also suspicious. "with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 - set two years ago to line up with the conference in melbourne - cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs." so scientists have been looking for the higgs boson since 1964, almost 50 years, and as of yesterday these cern physicists are finally able to 'divine its existence' from a 'bump in the data' that 'looks like' the higgs boson, only after 'racing' to meet a deadline specified years in advance?

"we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10-billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. mr. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, mr. heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," mr. heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. mr. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, dr. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say. but he told the audience that the discovery of something that appears to be so close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometre underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as ms. gianotti and mr. incandela each took their turn. mr. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" ms. gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. mr. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found. we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story," he said. "now, we're way out on the edge of exploration."

T	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind < swiss news | expatica switzerland
C	04/07/2012higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. join expatica's online community to reach out for expats just like you! switzerland's healthcare system information about the swiss healthcare system, health insurance, pharmacies and emergency numbers.

T	higgs boson discovery could be physics' holy grail
C	aspen, colo. - physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. joe incandela, a cern spokesman, right, gestured next to rolf-dieter heuer, cern's director general, during a press conference at the organization's offices near geneva on wednesday. the british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern's headquarters on wednesday. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter?

(july 4, 2012) geneva - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research ( cern ), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton 's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. -french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found."

T	cern physicists announce evidence pointing to existence of higgs boson
C	as expected, scientists at cern's large hadron collider made an announcement of significant confirmation of the existence of the elusive higgs boson, albeit not final confirmation of the existence of what has become popularly, and somewhat incorrectly, known as "the god particle": aspen, colo. - physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email, "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." the cern press release is, of course, cautious in describing what it is the scientists believe they have discovered: geneva, 4 july 2012. at a seminar held at cern 1 today as a curtain raiser to the year's major particle physics conference, ichep2012 in melbourne, the atlas and cms experiments presented their latest preliminary results in the search for the long sought higgs particle. both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev. "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage," said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, "but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication." "the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found," said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. "the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director sergio bertolucci. " we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data." five sigma certainty is the gold standard in particle physics and essentially means that the scientists are as certain that they can be that the measurements they recorded are not the result of an anomaly or random chance. as the bbc reports, professor peter higgs himself, who was part of the team of scientists whose work led tot the creation of the theories surrounding the higgs boson and, of course the still-theoretical particle that bears his name, was present for the announcement at cern: prof peter higgs, after whom the particle is named, wiped a tear from his eye as the teams finished their presentations in the cern auditorium. "i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement," he added later. "it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime." it's not often that you get particle physicists emotional, or popping champagne corks early in the morning as one group gathered in aspen, colorado did this morning, so that's a pretty good indication of just how big a deal this discovery is, and tom chivers tries to explain what it all means in layman's terms: first, as was hinted yesterday, the cms detector - one of the two major experiments at the large hadron collider - has definitely found something . prof james incandela, the spokesman for the experiment, said they have seen something "very strong, very solid" at the 125gev (gigaelectronvolt) mass, where they had thought they'd seen something in december. the first slide showed a curve of results, with a single bump up at 125gev. "it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks : "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. actually, it would probably be much more interesting if it turned out that this new particle

T	cern physicists announce evidence pointing to existence of higgs boson
C	as expected, scientists at cern's large hadron collider made an announcement of significant confirmation of the existence of the elusive higgs boson, albeit not final confirmation of the existence of what has become popularly, and somewhat incorrectly, known as "the god particle": aspen, colo. - physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email, "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." the cern press release is, of course, cautious in describing what it is the scientists believe they have discovered: geneva, 4 july 2012. at a seminar held at cern 1 today as a curtain raiser to the year's major particle physics conference, ichep2012 in melbourne, the atlas and cms experiments presented their latest preliminary results in the search for the long sought higgs particle. both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev. "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage," said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, "but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication." "the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found," said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. "the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director sergio bertolucci. " we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data." five sigma certainty is the gold standard in particle physics and essentially means that the scientists are as certain that they can be that the measurements they recorded are not the result of an anomaly or random chance. as the bbc reports, professor peter higgs himself, who was part of the team of scientists whose work led tot the creation of the theories surrounding the higgs boson and, of course the still-theoretical particle that bears his name, was present for the announcement at cern: prof peter higgs, after whom the particle is named, wiped a tear from his eye as the teams finished their presentations in the cern auditorium. "i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement," he added later. "it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime." it's not often that you get particle physicists emotional, or popping champagne corks early in the morning as one group gathered in aspen, colorado did this morning, so that's a pretty good indication of just how big a deal this discovery is, and tom chivers tries to explain what it all means in layman's terms: first, as was hinted yesterday, the cms detector - one of the two major experiments at the large hadron collider - has definitely found something . prof james incandela, the spokesman for the experiment, said they have seen something "very strong, very solid" at the 125gev (gigaelectronvolt) mass, where they had thought they'd seen something in december. the first slide showed a curve of results, with a single bump up at 125gev. "it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks : "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. actually, it would probably be much more interesting if it turned out that this new particle link). what's more impressive is that they did it in their spare time, not as their focus. but i'm afraid that is also an indictment of high-expense, high-energy, physics. big science is about ego and not roi. @ ben? actually?we spent the money on tax cuts for the rich. yup, the world would have been a better place if newton, pasteur, planck, einstein, watson and crick and the others who did the big science of their day had just taken up cards as a hobby - to paraphrase monty python, "what has (big science) ever done for us? nothing!" btw, those who point out how wasteful basic physics research is have some pretty impressive examples they can draw on - google the basic reaction to faraday's research on electricity, it was generally considered to be a waste of time and resources. our knowledge of chemistry, biochemistry, solid state electronics, and a number of things people take for granted came out of basic physics research that probed what "matter" was actually composed of. and its been called a waste of resources almost every step of the way ? usually with the caveate "yes, what we've learned so far is useful, but there's nothing more of use to be learned, so stop wasting resources looking into it". the discovery should have been made in the u.s., but we couldn't spare $20 billion for a supercollider. instead we spent trillions on better ways to kill, which of course is money well spent. with ebt cards and abortion? oh you meant the military and its scientists, the ones who have allowed you to cry and talk crap about them in english and with a head? why on earth do we need to make this kind of discovery? why isn't it better and cheaper to let the europeans count angels on pins? or how many dinosaurs it takes to make a barrel of oil? i will get excited when they make a breakthrough on time travel, which they will probably keep secret. this is the reason that thing was built to start with. do you think they will go back and try to kill jesus in the womb or his mom? actually?we spent the money on tax cuts for the rich. i can imagine the discussion in trying to get a cern-like project here today. seriously?republicans don't even believe evolution?try explaining the higgs boson to sarah palin or michelle bachmann. truly?why don't you explain evolution to me. i am feeling kind of down on this independence remembrance day and need a good laugh to cheer me up. that is without a doubt the most amazingly stupid post i have ever seen. can you show that the apollo guidance computer was anything other than an instance of then state of the art? video games did far, far, more to fund and advance computer science. when atari started buying 6502s, they bought more computers than had existed in history before. omg, do you think those are examples of "big science," the kinds of national hubris projects which attract billions? faraday did not receive a budget prominent enough to earn a line-item on his nations budget. what part of "big science" don't you understand? @ seriously?republicans don't even believe evolution?try explaining the higgs boson to sarah palin or michelle bachmann. we already know their opinions, i think: ethical challenges have been raised as well, with many considering the search for the so-called "god particle" to be a sign of human hubris. an analogy can be made to the biblical tower of babel. actually "big science" has always meant the same thing - science aiming at the fundamentals of a discipline. it was true of what newton and the royal society was doing (and the politics there were quite involved), in what faraday was doing, in what watson and crick were doing (and the race with linus pauling even had nationalistic overtones), and what is going on now. i'm an electrical engineer now, with graduate degrees in physics and engineering. if i ask a colleage for an example of big science, i suspect the first example i'd hear would be maxwell's equations (electrical engineers just think of that first) - and then after a pause probably newton's laws, quantum mechanics, and relativity. you seem to be talking about "expensive science" rather than "big science". there is some overlap - probing fundamental forces has always been expensive, and will probably become increasingly more so with time. but the rewards tend to be huge as well. would you really want to have medicine based on an understanding of physics that doesn't include the atom, electrons etc - ie no chemistry (all based on orbitals etc), biochem, molecular biology? there was no reason to search for those particles, other than the drive to understand what matter was made of. it would have made as much sense to stop researching fundamental physics in 1800 as it does today - no one was saying "we're going to come up with electricity, solidstate physics, biochem and all these things in a century or two if we research matter." make up your own semantics then. for me, and most people, big science is the stuff that kings and congresses fund. they are unified by their cost, not by their domain or their focus. a tremendous amount of good science was not big science in those terms. what did watson and crick's investigation into the structure of dna cost? what was it's later import? think about it. and don't hand-wave that pursuit of the boson must be important, because it's expensive, or because it's physics. your opinions regarding anyone who does anything other than engineering are well known. i'm afraid i don't agree. i've endorsed any number of scientific projects that are smaller, less expensive, and answer more pressing questions. .[1] individual or small group efforts, or small science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the large hadron collider costing between $5 and $10 billion. not even faraday's or newton's work was just done by individuals, or even small groups. read up on the collaboration (and competition) at the time. by the time of pasteur, let alone watson and crick, there were many groups around the world working on the base problems (watson and crick for instance relied on huge advances in x-ray diffraction, which they didn't develope themselves - others did, and that had been paid for mainly by gov'ts around the world). all that's changed in the definition is that in the case of cern the research is done in one location, instead of spread out over many countries. the romantic notion of a small group of scientists sitting in a room cut off from everyone else coming up with new science is nice, but has almost always been fictional. the only thing that changes with cern is that its a single location, instead of distributed. btw, anjin talked way up top about space flight. the big science aspect of that, the "manned" part, has arguably slowed funding in the most fruitful areas. unmanned. we are getting very good at crawling, walking, swimming, and flying drones, but we don't send them to space. why not? this is the kind of question that will frustrate the conventional thinker. because nasa in the 60?s rocked so hard, it must rock now, right? to borrow a phrase, "what have you done for me lately?" can anyone name an advance that came directly out of the "manned" part of space, even in the last 20 years? (the conventional thinker might also worry that if "manned" is not the best investment in this decade, that closes the door on the next. no, actually. good drone-craft can open the door for easier manned missions in the future. see also bootstrapping and automated mining and fabrication.) ?try explaining the higgs boson to sarah palin or michelle bachmann. perhaps they would think that was a character from the dukes of hazzard ? truly?why don't you explain evolution to me. for me, and most people, big science is the stuff that kings and congresses fund. they are unified by their cost, not by their domain or their focus. what cost more? shutting down the final construction the waxahachie project or completing it? @ john personna as i said, you should do some reading on the agc. this is a good place to start: @g.a.: that is without a doubt the most amazingly stupid post i have ever seen.

there was no reason to search for those particles, other than the drive to understand what matter was made of. it would have made as much sense to stop researching fundamental physics in 1800 as it does today - no one was saying "we're going to come up with electricity, solidstate physics, biochem and all these things in a century or two if we research matter." make up your own semantics then. for me, and most people, big science is the stuff that kings and congresses fund. they are unified by their cost, not by their domain or their focus. a tremendous amount of good science was not big science in those terms. what did watson and crick's investigation into the structure of dna cost? what was it's later import? think about it. and don't hand-wave that pursuit of the boson must be important, because it's expensive, or because it's physics. your opinions regarding anyone who does anything other than engineering are well known. i'm afraid i don't agree. i've endorsed any number of scientific projects that are smaller, less expensive, and answer more pressing questions. .[1] individual or small group efforts, or small science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the large hadron collider costing between $5 and $10 billion. not even faraday's or newton's work was just done by individuals, or even small groups. read up on the collaboration (and competition) at the time. by the time of pasteur, let alone watson and crick, there were many groups around the world working on the base problems (watson and crick for instance relied on huge advances in x-ray diffraction, which they didn't develope themselves - others did, and that had been paid for mainly by gov'ts around the world). all that's changed in the definition is that in the case of cern the research is done in one location, instead of spread out over many countries. the romantic notion of a small group of scientists sitting in a room cut off from everyone else coming up with new science is nice, but has almost always been fictional. the only thing that changes with cern is that its a single location, instead of distributed. btw, anjin talked way up top about space flight. the big science aspect of that, the "manned" part, has arguably slowed funding in the most fruitful areas. unmanned. we are getting very good at crawling, walking, swimming, and flying drones, but we don't send them to space. why not? this is the kind of question that will frustrate the conventional thinker. because nasa in the 60?s rocked so hard, it must rock now, right? to borrow a phrase, "what have you done for me lately?" can anyone name an advance that came directly out of the "manned" part of space, even in the last 20 years? (the conventional thinker might also worry that if "manned" is not the best investment in this decade, that closes the door on the next. no, actually. good drone-craft can open the door for easier manned missions in the future. see also bootstrapping and automated mining and fabrication.) ?try explaining the higgs boson to sarah palin or michelle bachmann. perhaps they would think that was a character from the dukes of hazzard ? truly?why don't you explain evolution to me. for me, and most people, big science is the stuff that kings and congresses fund. they are unified by their cost, not by their domain or their focus. what cost more? shutting down the final construction the waxahachie project or completing it? @ john personna as i said, you should do some reading on the agc. this is a good place to start:
Q	the god particle
Q	i think we have it,
Q	a historic milestone.
Q	higgs-like
Q	it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are,
Q	very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example.
Q	if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner,
Q	what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment.
Q	we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage,
Q	but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.
Q	the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,
Q	the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.
Q	it's hard not to get excited by these results,
Q	we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data.
Q	i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement,
Q	it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.
Q	very strong, very solid
Q	it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment
Q	channels
Q	are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?
Q	discovery
Q	what has (big science) ever done for us? nothing!

T	higgs boson found: scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' | mail online
C	professor higgs wipes a tear from his eye as fellow scientists find his 'god particle' on 'momentous day for science' - 40-years after he predicted its existence discovery of particle is most important in physics in decades leading physicists watch announcement at cern in switzerland end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle last jigsaw piece that proves our view of universe is right 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass audience includes professor peter higgs who suggested boson's existence prof higgs, 83: 'i had no idea this would happen in my lifetime' by rob waugh published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 08:24 est, 4 july 2012 comments ( 280 ) share the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that holds the universe together - is over. scientists at switzerland's cern (the european council for nuclear research) announced the discovery to an audience including professor peter higgs, who first suggested the existence of the particle four decades ago. professor higgs, 83, wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were announced, and later said: 'it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.' an audience of the world's leading physicists rose in a standing ovation to celebrate the find - the culmination of a decades-long search at the large hadron collider and other particle accelerators such as america's tevatron. the discovery is the biggest leap in physics for decades - filling in a crucial gap in our understanding of the atom. in the long term, the discovery could lead to new technologies. scroll down for video professor higgs, 83, wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were announced, and later said: 'it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.' two high-energy photons collide. their energy (the red lines) is measured in by an 'electromagnetic calorimeter'. the yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision. the pale blue volume shows the track through which the particles are sent joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, announces the discovery of a particle that corresponds to theories of the higgs boson at cern today the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle why the higgs matters - what the new particle means the existence of the higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. the higgs is the last missing piece of the standard model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the higgs is the last jigsaw piece. if the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the big bang, an invisible force known as the higgs field formed. this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles - or higgs bosons.as other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the higgs boson will be long term, but they could be in fields as diverse as medicine, computing and manufacturing. experts compare the search for the higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. the idea of the electron - a subatomic particle - was first floated in 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patients. professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, said: 'they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science.' 'this is indeed a new particle,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. the discovery fills in the last gap in the 'standard model' of physics - proving einstein right, and possibly leading to new technologies built on our understanding of the particle. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. more... 'britain's atlantis' found at bottom of north sea - a huge undersea kingdom swallowed by the sea in 6500bc michael hanlon: as rumours fly that physicists have discovered 'the god particle', are we about to know the mind of god? a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' is the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. 'we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev,' said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, 'but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.' 'the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,' said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. 'the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.' 'it's hard not to get excited by these results,' said cern research director sergio bertolucci. ' we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point.' prof higgs, who first postulated the theory more than 40 years ago, told the bbc: 'i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. 'i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them.' british physicist peter higgs (right) is welcomed by european organization for nuclear research (cern) director-general rolf-dieter heuer (left) british physicist peter higgs arrives for the conference near geneva inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider the 'god particle' - why the higgs hunt caused controversy the search for the particle caused controversy as members of the public feared that the high-energy collisions could cause a black hole or an interdimensional gateway in switzerland. religious groups also objected to the use of the term 'god particle' - although cern's scientists dislike the term just as much. nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman nicknamed the boson the 'god particle' in 1993 - which makes it popular in the media but has angered many scientists, including professor higgs himself. at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. physicists needed the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a model of the large hadron collider (lhc) tunnel is seen in the cern (european organization for nuclear research) visitors' center a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.' british scientists congratulate the cern team 'for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america.' - prof themis bowcock, university of liverpool british experts queued to heap praise on the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle bearing the hallmarks of the higgs boson. professor valentin khoze, director of durham university's institute for particle physics phenomenology (ippp), said: 'the mounting evidence that higgs bosons have been produced and detected at the large hadron collider experiment at cern is a triumph for particle physics. 'without the higgs particle, other particles, such as electrons and quarks, would be massless and the universe would not be what it is. 'now, with the amazing results from the lhc, we are finally finding growing experimental evidence that the higgs really exists. 'the second part of the story about the higgs particle is even more exciting as it provides us with a window to new physics - a tool for the exploration of the truly unknown.' professor jordan nash, head of high energy physics at imperial college london, said: 'this is a fantastic result. 'we are all thrilled to be a part of this discovery and are looking forward with anticipation to studying this new particle and whatever surprises its behaviour may have in store for us.' professor jerome gauntlett, head of theoretical physics at imperial college london, said: 'the discovery of the higgs boson is a truly great moment for science. 'its origins go back to the 1960s with enormous contributions made by peter higgs in edinburgh and by tom kibble and nobel laureate abdus salam at imperial. 'it is fantastic moment for british science that 50 years later on we have received such dramatic confirmation of their profound ideas. like all great discoveries, more detailed studies of the higgs are likely to have a huge impact on future fundamental scientific inquiry. 'i expect that they will illuminate the nature of the mysterious dark matter that pervades the universe, whether or not there are extra dimensions in addition to the three space dimensions that we observe, and ultimately how to unify the standard model of particle physics with einstein's theory of gravity.' british physicist peter higgs (l) talks to fabiola gianotti, atlas experiment spokesperson, next to cern director general rolf heuer after the news conference professor paul dauncey, professor of particle physics at imperial college london said: 'this is a major breakthrough for our understanding of the universe. 'if this new particle is what we think it is, then it is a completely new type of particle never seen before. we can think of it as the final piece of the puzzle, completing what is considered to be the 'standard' theory. 'but no-one thinks that's really the end of the story, so it might also be the beginning of a new chapter in physics, the first step to a more fundamental view of how everything came to exist. that's why physicists are excited; we just don't know where this will lead.' professor sir timothy o'shea, principal of the university of edinburgh, said: 'we are delighted at this significant development in the search for the higgs boson, and congratulate professor peter higgs on this. 'this particle is integral to our understanding of the physical world and evidence of its existence is a testament to professor higgs and to all the scientists who are working to uncover it. 'professor higgs has inspired many colleagues and students over the years, some of whom have also gone on to become involved in the large hadron collider experiments. his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of physicists, at edinburgh and beyond.' participants applaud after the presentation results during a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson prof stefan soldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the university of manchester, said: 'today we have witnessed a discovery which gives unique insight into our understanding of the universe and the origin of the masses of fundamental particles. 'there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists and we now have to understand its properties and whether it behaves exactly as predicted by theory.' professor dave charlton, deputy spokesperson for the atlas experiment at the university of birmingham's school of physics and astronomy, said: 'many people have been working night and day to analyse the fresh data from the lhc which has been pouring in this year, which has allowed us to reveal these exciting preliminary results today. 'the tantalising hints we saw in december are repeated and strengthened in the new atlas data, so we're now quite confident that we're seeing a new particle. 'finding out if it's got all the properties of the standard model's higgs boson will need a lot more data and painstaking work. we're now opening a new chapter of fundamental physics, as the lhc was designed to do.' prof themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, who has worked on the lhc, said: 'this is cast-iron proof that a new particle has been discovered. it looks like the higgs. 'for physicists the dice are definitely now loaded in favour of a discovery. based on the cern results alone there appears to be less than one chance in a million that this is fake, which is roughly the same probability as flipping a coin heads-up 21 times in a row. very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle. 'half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature. 'for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america.' video: prof higgs makes rare public appearance at press conference

T	physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle' - the times of india
C	share and discuss tweet evidence of 'god particle' found: cern see photo geneva: to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle on wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the " god particle " - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. ``as a layman, i think we did it,'' he told the elated crowd. ``we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson.'' the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said on wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "what do we have?" the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the ``standard model'' higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question on wednesday. ``it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model,'' heuer said. ``we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson.'' higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. ``it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime,'' he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-km underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it ``a higgs-like particle'' and said ``we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found.'' ``thanks, nature!'' gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that ``the standard model (of physics) is not complete'' but that ``the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that.'' the phrase ``god particle'' was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. ``this boson is a very profound thing we have found,'' he said. ``we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration.''

C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle scientists at the cern research centre in switzerland reveal they have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson link to this video there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simple proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: "this is sensational news and quite brilliant science. without doubt, cern has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level. i have waited over 20 years for this moment and am thrilled by the news. the excitement will continue now, as we all try to figure out just how this thing behaves." john ellis, who has worked at cern since the 1970s, said the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. "now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? "the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter." "we're not certain, but i'd be willing to bet the house this turns out to be some sort of higgs particle," said joe incandela, spokesperson for the cms collaboration. higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle follow all the top science stories of the day on twitter quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

T	'god particle': cern scientists find new particle, probably the higgs boson - the times of india
C	share and discuss tweet evidence of 'god particle' found: cern see photo geneva: scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. "we have indeed discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson," john womersley, head of a british public research body, told journalists and scientists in london on wednesday. "these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe." joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." cern's director general rolph heuer said: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it." addressing the scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer asked: "would you agree?" they burst into applause. peter higgs , the 83-year-old british physicist who proposed the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s, was at cern to welcome the news. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes brimming, he told the symposium: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model. it could also be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva and london to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn. "we still much we don't know about particles - this is only the beginning of a new journey. we have closed one chapter and opened another," peter knight of britain's institute of physics said. oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters: "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. "but we can't yet say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." higgs called it a great achievement for the large hadron collider , the 27-km (17-mile) long particle accelerator built in a tunnel underneath the french-swiss border where experiments to search for the higgs boson have taken place. in a statement, he added: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge."
Q	we have indeed discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson,
Q	these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe.
Q	this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid.

T	higgs boson discovery: now the real work begins | science | guardian.co.uk
C	ian sample, science correspondent at cern, geneva proton-proton collisions as measured by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) in its search for the higgs boson particle. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images the search for the arcane, theoretical particle known as the higgs boson has drawn on the world's largest scientific instruments and occupied thousands of researchers over more than two decades. physics lab near geneva, will go down as a triumph of science, engineering and collective hard graft. now the real work begins. months and years of analysis lie ahead to confirm that the particle is the elusive higgs boson. if so, physicists want to know whether it is the simplest kind of particle put forward in physicists' theories, or something more unusual - and more exciting. "it's clear there's a great deal more to be done experimentally, even after they announce a discovery," says steven weinberg, a professor of physics at the university of texas at austin, who won the nobel prize in 1979 for work that used the maths behind the higgs theory to show how two forces of nature, the electromagnetic force that carries light, and the weak force, which drives some kinds of radioactive decay, were one in the early universe. the higgs boson appears in a theory first fleshed out in 1964 by peter higgs at edinburgh university and five other physicists. finding the particle proves there is an energy field that fills the vacuum of the observable universe. it plays the crucial role of giving mass to certain subatomic particles that are the building blocks of matter. the higgs field is thought to have switched on a trillionth of a second after the big bang that blasted the universe into existence. without it, or something to do its job, the structure of the cosmos would be radically different than it is today. the tough job ahead is working out whether the higgs particle is the simple, singular particle that underpins what physicists call the standard model - a set of equations that describe how all the known particles behave - or something more complex. one possibility is that the particle they have found is one of a larger family of higgs particles. to find out, they must study in exquisite detail how the particle is made in the lhc and how it disintegrates into other, more familiar particles as soon as it is created. "it will take a lot of time. i don't mean decades, but perhaps years, to verify all the predictions of the standard model about how the particle is produced and how it decays," says weinberg. the race to discover the higgs particle has played out on both sides of the atlantic. in the us, the government-owned fermilab near chicago used the giant tevatron collider to look for the particle. in cern began the hunt in earnest in the 1990s with a predecessor to the large hadron collider. the rivalry has been intense, and for the best part, friendly. on monday, scientists at the tevatron, their strongest evidence yet for the higgs boson . some scientists saw the move as a spoiler for cern's announcement. "the timing of the fermilab announcement was below the belt," says philip anderson, a physics nobel laureate at princeton university. the race at cern now is to collect as much information about the particle as possible before the large hadron collider closes down for about two years at the end of 2012, when engineers are due to carry out repairs to enable the machine to run at its full design energy. following a helium gas explosion that wrecked part of the collider in 2008, the machine was restricted to running at half energy until the higgs boson was discovered or comfortably ruled out. "seeing something new is really the beginning of this long journey to understand what on earth it is that you have seen," says tara shears, a particle physicist at liverpool university who works on the lhcb detector at cern. "it's like turning up to a railway station to pick someone up who you've never met before. you arrive at the station, the train comes in, and there's someone standing on the platform. you're guessing it's them, but you're not going to know until you walk up and check who they are." much is riding on what cern finds, or fails to find. some physicists fear the laboratory might discover only the simplest form of higgs particle and nothing more exotic. that would plug a hole in the standard model, but give scientists no leads to help them understand other pressing mysteries in nature. what is the invisible dark matter that clings to galaxies and makes up a quarter of the mass of the cosmos? what is dark energy, thought to drive the expansion of the universe? why are we made of matter instead of antimatter? why is gravity so weak? the standard model has nothing to say on these questions. physicists have no answers. "i had a nightmare which is that cern would discover the higgs boson and then nothing else. discovering the higgs particle, gratifying as it is, does not provide a clue to how to go beyond the standard model," says weinberg. despite intense efforts, the large hadron collider has not found anything unexpected so far. "i find it a very depressing prospect, the possibility that this may be the last great discovery for many decades," weinberg added. frank wilczek, a professor at mit who won the nobel prize for physics in 2004, is more upbeat about cern's prospects. "so far, this all fits with the very minimal, economical version of the standard model, there's no sign of anything fancy. but there's plenty of room for it, it's unexplored territory." a family of higgs particles is predicted by many versions of a theory called supersymmetry, which says that all the known kinds of particles in nature have heavy, invisible twins that have yet to be discovered. so far at the lhc, there is no sign of supersymmetric particles, which have names such as "squarks" and "stops" and "gluinos". one of the great attractions of supersymmetry is that it shows how three of the four forces of nature were one in the early universe and separated later, leaving only gravity unaccounted for. some particles predicted by supersymmetry are prime candidates to make up dark matter. the large hadron collider was never just a higgs-hunting machine. other research programmes hope to understand dark matter, dark energy, antimatter, and look for extra dimensions for space. hidden extra dimensions are woven into string theory, an ambitious area of physics that describes particles as tiny vibrating threads of energy. higgs boson discovery: now the real work begins higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle 'god particle' that gives mass to the universe thought to have been found in large hadron collider, announce scientists higgs boson: us physicists find strongest evidence yet of 'god particle' why the higgs particle hunt was always going to be a waiting game strong hints of the higgs boson from tevatron particle collider in us higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle @mjrobbins we pity your children who will grow up in a climate of gender apartheid thanks to your ignorance quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

"it's clear there's a great deal more to be done experimentally, even after they announce a discovery," says steven weinberg, a professor of physics at the university of texas at austin, who won the nobel prize in 1979 for work that used the maths behind the higgs theory to show how two forces of nature, the electromagnetic force that carries light, and the weak force, which drives some kinds of radioactive decay, were one in the early universe. the higgs boson appears in a theory first fleshed out in 1964 by peter higgs at edinburgh university and five other physicists. finding the particle proves there is an energy field that fills the vacuum of the observable universe. it plays the crucial role of giving mass to certain subatomic particles that are the building blocks of matter. the higgs field is thought to have switched on a trillionth of a second after the big bang that blasted the universe into existence. without it, or something to do its job, the structure of the cosmos would be radically different than it is today. the tough job ahead is working out whether the higgs particle is the simple, singular particle that underpins what physicists call the standard model - a set of equations that describe how all the known particles behave - or something more complex. one possibility is that the particle they have found is one of a larger family of higgs particles. to find out, they must study in exquisite detail how the particle is made in the lhc and how it disintegrates into other, more familiar particles as soon as it is created. "it will take a lot of time. i don't mean decades, but perhaps years, to verify all the predictions of the standard model about how the particle is produced and how it decays," says weinberg. the race to discover the higgs particle has played out on both sides of the atlantic. in the us, the government-owned fermilab near chicago used the giant tevatron collider to look for the particle. in cern began the hunt in earnest in the 1990s with a predecessor to the large hadron collider. the rivalry has been intense, and for the best part, friendly. on monday, scientists at the tevatron, their strongest evidence yet for the higgs boson . some scientists saw the move as a spoiler for cern's announcement. "the timing of the fermilab announcement was below the belt," says philip anderson, a physics nobel laureate at princeton university. the race at cern now is to collect as much information about the particle as possible before the large hadron collider closes down for about two years at the end of 2012, when engineers are due to carry out repairs to enable the machine to run at its full design energy. following a helium gas explosion that wrecked part of the collider in 2008, the machine was restricted to running at half energy until the higgs boson was discovered or comfortably ruled out. "seeing something new is really the beginning of this long journey to understand what on earth it is that you have seen," says tara shears, a particle physicist at liverpool university who works on the lhcb detector at cern. "it's like turning up to a railway station to pick someone up who you've never met before. you arrive at the station, the train comes in, and there's someone standing on the platform. you're guessing it's them, but you're not going to know until you walk up and check who they are." much is riding on what cern finds, or fails to find. some physicists fear the laboratory might discover only the simplest form of higgs particle and nothing more exotic. that would plug a hole in the standard model, but give scientists no leads to help them understand other pressing mysteries in nature. what is the invisible dark matter that clings to galaxies and makes up a quarter of the mass of the cosmos? what is dark energy, thought to drive the expansion of the universe? why are we made of matter instead of antimatter? why is gravity so weak? the standard model has nothing to say on these questions. physicists have no answers.

T	god particle: we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature, scientists say - the times of india
C	share and discuss tweet scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. geneva: after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the elusive higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation erupted at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented astonishing new data in their search for the mysterious particle. many hailed it as a moment in history, and white-haired veterans of the quest shed tears of joy. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. he and others cautioned, though, that further work was needed to identify what exactly had been found. "as a layman i would say we have it, but as a scientist i have to say, 'what do we have?'" heuer told a press conference. "we have discovered a boson, and now we have to determine what kind of boson it is." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who in 1964 published the conceptual groundwork for the particle and whose name became associated with it, expressed delight. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," the 83-year-old said in a statement. higgs sat next to belgian physicist francois englert, 79, who separately contributed to the theory. "i just want to say that my thoughts go to robert brout," said englert, his eyes moist with tears, as he lauded a fellow pioneer who died in 2011 before the once-outlandish theory could be proved. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. the higgs has been dubbed the " god particle " because it is powerful and ubiquitous yet so hard to find. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." at a particle-physics conference in melbourne, australia, a participant said there was a "jaw-dropping" moment when the scientists reacted to the announcement. history was then feted with beer and champagne. scientists began to pore over what the find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe , a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. "it may be the higgs boson, but it may also be something far bigger, which opens the door towards a new theory that goes beyond the standard model."

"i just want to say that my thoughts go to robert brout," said englert, his eyes moist with tears, as he lauded a fellow pioneer who died in 2011 before the once-outlandish theory could be proved. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. the higgs has been dubbed the " god particle " because it is powerful and ubiquitous yet so hard to find. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." at a particle-physics conference in melbourne , australia, a participant said there was a "jaw-dropping" moment when the scientists reacted to the announcement. history was then feted with beer and champagne. scientists began to pore over what the find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe , a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. "it may be the higgs boson, but it may also be something far bigger, which opens the door towards a new theory that goes beyond the standard model."

T	cempaka eco green: higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle
C	'god particle' that gives mass to the universe thought to have been found in large hadron collider, announce scientists guardian.co.uk , ian sample at cern, geneva, wednesday 4 july 2012 a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , near geneva, home of the large hadron collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson , the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics . "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo, a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simplest proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. related articles: factbox: what is the big bang? what is the higgs boson and why is it important?

T	news update: new subatomic evidence points to elusive 'god particle'
C	ctvnews.ca staff published wednesday, jul. 4, 2012 6:02am edt last updated wednesday, jul. 4, 2012 8:12am edt all that atom-smashing in europe's $10 billion large hadron collider has paid off in a big discovery that scientists say helps explain another mystery of the universe. the head of the world's biggest atom-smasher -- the european centre for nuclear research (cern) on the swiss-french border -- told a crowd of excited scientists wednesday that researchers have discovered evidence consistent with theories of the subatomic building-clock popularly referred to as the "god particle." "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," cern director rolf heuer said during a presentation in geneva. "as a layman, i think we did it," he said. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." bosons are believed to be the basic building blocks of the universe, tiny elementary particles from which everything is made. the higgs boson, named after the scottish physicist peter higgs who was among the first to theorize about it in the 1960s, is seen as key to understanding why some particles have mass, while others do not. according to the theory, there is an energy field that pervades the known universe, interacting with the quarks and electrons that make up the atomic building blocks of everything in it. without the higgs field, there would be no matter, and therefore no planets, or life as we know it. scientists have been hunting for a higgs boson, because finding a particle of the pervasive energy field is the simplest way to prove the invisible field is actually out there. to find it, they've been smashing protons together -- more than 1,000 trillion times, in fact - trying to create a higgs boson in the collision. in the rare times they produce one, it decays so quickly they have to sift through the atomic debris for evidence of the particles it decays into. that's why, when asked whether the complicated findings presented wednesday represent a "discovery," heuer drew a distinction between what the experts have learned and what the average person should take away. "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, 'what do we have?'" he said, explaining more research is needed to pin down exactly how it fits in with their theories. heuer's comments followed the presentation of findings by two independent teams that have been working at the underground research facility, both of which said they have "observed" a particle that could be the one they've been looking for, or at least a variation of it. joe incandela, spokesperson for the 2,100-scientist cms team, said it was too soon to say definitively whether their data pointing to the existence of a particle weighing in at 125.3 gigaelectronvolts (gev) is the "standard model" higgs. but whatever it is exactly, he said it's a big find. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found. we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story," he said. "now, we're way out on the edge of exploration." fabiola gianotti, spokesperson for the 3,000-strong atlas research team, also cautioned that their work -- which documents evidence of a similar, but slightly higher mass particle -- is far from complete. the dream, she said, "is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything -- we are far from that." but, based on the "sigma" scale particle physicists use to rank the certainty of their findings, the teams rated their results at the top of scale reserved for cases in which there's less than a one in a million chance of being wrong. the headline-grabbing name "god particle" was popularized in the title of a book by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but is not favoured by researchers in the field. the popular phrase goes a long way to capturing its significance, however, as scientists say the confirmation of a higgs boson could unlock our understanding of the so-called dark matter and dark energy comprises the 96 per cent of the universe they believe is out there, but otherwise unobservable.

"we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. physicists celebrate evidence of new particle to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it 'consistent' with the long-sought higgs boson we hope you have enjoyed your complimentary access. become a subscriber today to enjoy these benefits: ipad-optimized edition mobile site & iphone app are you currently a subscriber? set up your digital access now. you now have full access. thank you for subscribing. access the tablet-optimized site, mobile site and iphone app share your access with any friend or family member subscriber exclusive top 5 daily email newsletter create an account or if you have a digital profile you must have browser cookies enabled to view our site. it's possible that your browser cookies are turned off. to continue using your current web browser, adobe flash must be installed or upgraded:

'this is indeed a new particle,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. the discovery fills in the last gap in the 'standard model' of physics - proving einstein right, and possibly leading to new technologies built on our understanding of the particle. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. more... 'britain's atlantis' found at bottom of north sea - a huge undersea kingdom swallowed by the sea in 6500bc michael hanlon: as rumours fly that physicists have discovered 'the god particle', are we about to know the mind of god? a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' is the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. 'we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev,' said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, 'but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.' 'the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,' said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. 'the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.' 'it's hard not to get excited by these results,' said cern research director sergio bertolucci. ' we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point.' prof higgs, who first postulated the theory more than 40 years ago, told the bbc: 'i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. 'i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them.' british physicist peter higgs (right) is welcomed by european organization for nuclear research (cern) director-general rolf-dieter heuer (left) british physicist peter higgs arrives for the conference near geneva inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider the 'god particle' - why the higgs hunt caused controversy the search for the particle caused controversy as members of the public feared that the high-energy collisions could cause a black hole or an interdimensional gateway in switzerland. religious groups also objected to the use of the term 'god particle' - although cern's scientists dislike the term just as much. nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman nicknamed the boson the 'god particle' in 1993 - which makes it popular in the media but has angered many scientists, including professor higgs himself. at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. physicists needed the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a model of the large hadron collider (lhc) tunnel is seen in the cern (european organization for nuclear research) visitors' center a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.' british scientists congratulate the cern team 'for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america.' - prof themis bowcock, university of liverpool british experts queued to heap praise on the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle bearing the hallmarks of the higgs boson. professor valentin khoze, director of durham university's institute for particle physics phenomenology (ippp), said: 'the mounting evidence that higgs bosons have been produced and detected at the large hadron collider experiment at cern is a triumph for particle physics. 'without the higgs particle, other particles, such as electrons and quarks, would be massless and the universe would not be what it is. 'now, with the amazing results from the lhc, we are finally finding growing experimental evidence that the higgs really exists. 'the second part of the story about the higgs particle is even more exciting as it provides us with a window to new physics - a tool for the exploration of the truly unknown.' professor jordan nash, head of high energy physics at imperial college london, said: 'this is a fantastic result. 'we are all thrilled to be a part of this discovery and are looking forward with anticipation to studying this new particle and whatever surprises its behaviour may have in store for us.' professor jerome gauntlett, head of theoretical physics at imperial college london, said: 'the discovery of the higgs boson is a truly great moment for science. 'its origins go back to the 1960s with enormous contributions made by peter higgs in edinburgh and by tom kibble and nobel laureate abdus salam at imperial. 'it is fantastic moment for british science that 50 years later on we have received such dramatic confirmation of their profound ideas. like all great discoveries, more detailed studies of the higgs are likely to have a huge impact on future fundamental scientific inquiry. 'i expect that they will illuminate the nature of the mysterious dark matter that pervades the universe, whether or not there are extra dimensions in addition to the three space dimensions that we observe, and ultimately how to unify the standard model of particle physics with einstein's theory of gravity.' british physicist peter higgs (l) talks to fabiola gianotti, atlas experiment spokesperson, next to cern director general rolf heuer after the news conference professor paul dauncey, professor of particle physics at imperial college london said: 'this is a major breakthrough for our understanding of the universe. 'if this new particle is what we think it is, then it is a completely new type of particle never seen before. we can think of it as the final piece of the puzzle, completing what is considered to be the 'standard' theory. 'but no-one thinks that's really the end of the story, so it might also be the beginning of a new chapter in physics, the first step to a more fundamental view of how everything came to exist. that's why physicists are excited; we just don't know where this will lead.' professor sir timothy o'shea, principal of the university of edinburgh, said: 'we are delighted at this significant development in the search for the higgs boson, and congratulate professor peter higgs on this. 'this particle is integral to our understanding of the physical world and evidence of its existence is a testament to professor higgs and to all the scientists who are working to uncover it. 'professor higgs has inspired many colleagues and students over the years, some of whom have also gone on to become involved in the large hadron collider experiments. his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of physicists, at edinburgh and beyond.' participants applaud after the presentation results during a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson prof stefan soldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the university of manchester, said: 'today we have witnessed a discovery which gives unique insight into our understanding of the universe and the origin of the masses of fundamental particles. 'there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists and we now have to understand its properties and whether it behaves exactly as predicted by theory.' professor dave charlton, deputy spokesperson for the atlas experiment at the university of birmingham's school of physics and astronomy, said: 'many people have been working night and day to analyse the fresh data from the lhc which has been pouring in this year, which has allowed us to reveal these exciting preliminary results today. 'the tantalising hints we saw in december are repeated and strengthened in the new atlas data, so we're now quite confident that we're seeing a new particle. 'finding out if it's got all the properties of the standard model's higgs boson will need a lot more data and painstaking work. we're now opening a new chapter of fundamental physics, as the lhc was designed to do.' prof themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, who has worked on the lhc, said: 'this is cast-iron proof that a new particle has been discovered. it looks like the higgs. 'for physicists the dice are definitely now loaded in favour of a discovery. based on the cern results alone there appears to be less than one chance in a million that this is fake, which is roughly the same probability as flipping a coin heads-up 21 times in a row. very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle. 'half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature.

T	'god particle': cern scientists find new particle, probably the higgs boson - the times of india
C	share and discuss tweet evidence of 'god particle' found: cern see photo geneva: scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. "we have indeed discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson," john womersley, head of a british public research body, told journalists and scientists in london on wednesday. "these results mark a significant breakthrough in our understanding of the fundamental laws that govern the universe." joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." cern's director general rolph heuer said: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it." addressing the scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer asked: "would you agree?" they burst into applause. peter higgs , the 83-year-old british physicist who proposed the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s, was at cern to welcome the news. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes brimming, he told the symposium: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model. it could also be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva and london to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn. "we still much we don't know about particles - this is only the beginning of a new journey. we have closed one chapter and opened another," peter knight of britain's institute of physics said. oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters: "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. "but we can't yet say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." higgs called it a great achievement for the large hadron collider , the 27-km (17-mile) long particle accelerator built in a tunnel underneath the french-swiss border where experiments to search for the higgs boson have taken place. in a statement, he added: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge."

T	physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle' | physicists, celebrate, evidence - the telegraph
C	geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed.

T	cern: higgs boson-like particle detected
C	what the scientific community has been eagerly waiting for for nearly 45 years now stands to be possibly the most significant discovery in the last 50 years of science but it may possibly be bitter sweet as though scientists have said that a new sub atomic particle has been discovered, they are not yet sure whether this particle is indeed the elusive higgs boson or a particle that closely resembles it. the week had started off with news that two separate team of 'higgs hunters', cms and atlas at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) would be making an announcement on wednesday regarding their research into discovering the higgs boson and as promised, cern today announced that the teams had discovered a particle that was 'consistent' with the higgs boson, saying that both teams had come close to a "discovery" but added that more research was needed to confirm that the particle was indeed the much coveted particle. speaking at the press conference, professor rolf heuer, director or cern said, "as a layman i would now say i think we have it. we have a discovery - we have observed a new particle consistent with a higgs boson. but which one? that remains open. it is a historic milestone but it is only the beginning." professor peter higgs, the british physicist after whom the particle was named, was moved to tears at the cern presentation saying, "i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement," he added later. it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime." regarding the data itself, the cms team has claimed to have achieved a five-sigma point level of certainty with respect to their data sets, meaning that there was a one in 3.5 million chance that what they had observed was not a higgs particle. in the cms team's data, the researchers noticed a "bump" which was the weight equivalent of a particle that weighed 125.3 gigaelectronvolts (gev), some 133 times heavier than a proton. however it was seen that by combining all the data sets of the cms team, only a 4.9 sigma was achieved meaning a one in two million chance. cms team spokesperson, prof joe incandela said "the results are preliminary but the five-sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle." british physicist peter higgs talks to fabiola gianotti, atlas experiment spokesperson, next to cern director general rolf heuer in meyrin zee news higgs-like new particle found zeenews bureau geneva: in one of the most significant scientific discoveries ever, two independent teams of scientists announced on wednesday the discovery of a new subatomic particle that has close resemblance to the... higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of... auditorium on july 4 in geneva, switzerland, physicists say they have found a new subatomic particle that has properties "consistent" with the long sought-after higgs boson. since the 1960's, scientists have been in search of the higgs boson... the hindu confirmation may have to wait until the end of 2012 scientists could have caught their first glimpse of the higgs boson, the curious particle thought to underpin the subatomic workings of nature. large hadron collider (lhc), revealed evidence for the... he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself an extremely fine distinction.

T	higgs boson video leaks to cern website | science | guardian.co.uk
C	a wall painting at cern shows how a higgs boson might look. photograph: anja niedringhaus/ap physics laboratory near geneva appeared to leak crucial details of its hunt for the long-sought senior scientists at cern are due to reveal the latest findings in the hunt for the famed particle at a much-anticipated press conference in geneva on wednesday, and had tried to keep the results under wraps, despite intense rumours that the laboratory had found the particle. but cern, which takes credit for inventing the world wide web, inadvertently released a video interview on its website dated 4 july 2012 in which spokesman joe incandela states the lab has "observed a new particle". a press officer at the laboratory blamed a technical glitch for the video going live. the interview was taken down shortly after. speaking on the video, incandela stopped short of claiming the particle was the higgs boson, saying more work was needed to be sure. "we have quite strong evidence that there's something there. it's properties are still going to take us a little bit of time," he said. the details incandela revealed suggest it has the hallmarks of the higgs particle. "we can see that it decays into two photons, for example, which tells us it's a boson, it's a particle with integer spin, and we know its mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the proton. and this is very significant. "this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all this, which i think we will," he said. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks," he added. a spokesperson for cern said the video went live on the internet due to a "technical fault". they added that the lab had recorded several videos in advance with spokespersons at the lab. two teams of physicists at cern are preparing to announce their latest efforts to discover the higgs boson at a press conference at the laboratory on wednesday morning. details will be unveiled by fabiola gianotti and incandela, the respective leaders of teams that use the giant atlas and cms detectors to search for new particles. the higgs boson, named after the edinburgh university physicist peter higgs, who proposed it in 1964, has become the most sought-after particle in modern science and its discovery is a major focus of research at the lhc. discovery of the particle would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space. without it, or something to do its job, there would be no stars, planets or life as we know it. according to theory, the higgs field switched on a trillionth of a second after the big bang that flung the universe into existence. before this moment, all of the particles in the universe were massless and zipped around at the speed of light. when the higgs field switched on, it changed the future of the universe. particles such as the quarks and electrons that make up normal matter felt a "drag" from the field, which manifests itself as mass. the more a particle feels the field, the heavier it becomes. some particles, like photons, pass through the field untouched, and so remain massless and move at the speed of light. some theories known as "supersymmetry" predict the existence of several kinds of higgs particles, along with a host of other particles that have yet to be discovered. higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

"we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration." 205 n. michigan avenue ground floor chicago, il 60601

T	higgs boson: cern scientists discover what looks like god particle
C	scientists find what looks like god particle british physicist peter higgs, after whom the higgs particle is named, was invited to take part in the announcement at the cern offices photo by fabrice coffrini/afp/gettyimages after days of leaks and rumors it's official: scientists at europe's cern research center have found a subatomic particle that very much looks like the higgs boson. they couldn't quite affirm they had discovere it, but you wouldn't have known it from the cheers, standing ovations, and general jubilant atmosphere that gave the cern auditorium the atmosphere of a rock concert, as one physicist tells the for those who lined up for hours for a chance to get into the geneva auditorium there was certainly little doubt about the importance of this morning's announcement. yet rolf heuer, director of cern made it clear that while the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, he couldn't quite say it is the higgs boson-"an extremely fine distinction," explains the scientists really don't like it when you call the higgs boson, the "god particle," but it's little wonder that's how it's popularly known. (for the record, it's called that because publishers thought it'd be a marketable title for a book, notes the telegraph.) after all, physicists have long theorized the higgs boson is "so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist," explains the washington post. essentially, the standard model, which has ruled physics for almost half a century, states that the higgs field is what weighs down particles and gives them mass so they're not just bouncing around at the speed of light. and the higgs boson "is the only visible and particular manifestation" of that "invisible force field," writes the times. (video embedded below does a good job of explaining how the whole thing works.) peter higgs, the 83-year-old physicist who theorized of the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s, was at cern and wiped away a tear as he heard the news, according to the it's particularly significant because the higgs particle is really the "last undiscovered piece of the standard model," as reuters explains. yet all this talk about the higgs ignores the fact that scientists don't yet know whether what they discovered is the higgs boson or merely a variation. although it may seem counterintuitive, it would be far more exciting for the scientists if it were a variation of the higgs idea or even a whole new subatomic particle, which could lead to an entirely new way of thinking of how matter is structured. north korea's new image shaped by platform shoes, earrings, and cell phones slate is published by the slate group, a division of the washington post company

T	relevant science: cern physicists may have discovered higgs boson particle
C	by dennis overbye aspen, colo. - physicists working at cern 's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email, "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and chair of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads - will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half power. physicists had been holding their breaths and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti and the other cms, led by dr. incandela -operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a break-neck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday and where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory, including peter higgs of the university of edinburgh, had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr. incandela's making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn.dr. incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant sandstorm into a man on horseback in the movie "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal has grown over the last year, until it practically jumps off the chart, according to those who have seen it. "i believe it now, i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy -einstein showed they are the same - that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood their signal was due to a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela and dr. gianotti's presentations were constantly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. fabiola gianotti, of cern and spokeswoman for the atlas team, said one on point, "why are you applauding, i'm not done yet. this is just beginning, there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviors and channels, "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons; and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr. higgs of the university of edinburgh, was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london, carl hagen of university of rochester, dr. guralnik of brown university, and francois englert and the late robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr. heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of the year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing some its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgs-like fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an anti-gravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe, and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said dr. tonelli. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, but the extra bounty of higgs bosons suggests that the standard model is cracking, a prospect that the physicists find thrilling. in an email, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team at cern wrote about the higgs, "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nyt

C	cern announces new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson geneva/london, july 4 (reuters): scientists at the cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe.

"i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of britain's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle, told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and even life. the theory goes that without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model, which describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists don't yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model, a variant of the higgs or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting.

C	recipient's email address (separate multiple addresses with a comma) so it's finally, probably, maybe, happened. although they are still hedging a bit, physicists at cern, the european organization for nuclear research, announced this morning that they had found the long-sought higgs boson. first postulated almost a half century ago by physicist peter higgs (who attended the press conference today at cern) and others, the higgs particle is believed to confer mass to quarks, electrons and other building blocks of our world. (for a primer on the higgs, after presentations by two groups gathering data from cern's large hadron collider, cern director general rolf dieter heuer said, according to the independent, "as a layman, i would say that i think we have it. do you agree?" after the audience erupted into applause, heuer added, "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle consistent with a higgs boson?but which one, it remains open." "if scientists are lucky," physicist-journalist adrian cho noted in science that "even as physicists celebrate, the discovery raises worries among some that there may remain no new physics that can be discovered with the atom-smasher." cho quoted nobel laureate steven weinberg: "my nightmare, and it's not just me, but a lot of us [in particle physics], is that the lhc discovers the higgs boson and nothing else? that would be like closing a door." my glum take on the higgs and the future of physics last december, after reports that the lhc had turned up "tantalizing hints" of the higgs unleashed the hounds of hype. i was especially annoyed by a responding to my column , kaku called me "an agent provocateur, throwing flames in all directions, and hoping that some of them may start a fire." but he conceded that i raised "real and thoughtful scientific questions." because my views haven't changed-and because i think they are still relevant-i'm reprinting an edited version of that december column (along with the same groovy image). here goes: the higgs has long been a mixed blessing for particle physics. in the early 1990s, when physicists were pleading-ultimately in vain-with congress not to cancel the superconducting supercollider, which was sucking up tax dollars faster than a black hole, the nobel laureate leon lederman christened the higgs "the god particle." this is scientific hype at its most outrageous. if the higgs is the "god particle," what should we call an even more fundamental particle, like a string? the godhead particle? the mother of god particle? the goddamn particle" might have been a better name for the higgs, given how hard it had been to detect "and the expense it is causing." a more fundamental problem is that discovering the higgs would be a modest, even anti-climactic achievement, relative to the grand ambitions of theoretical physics. the higgs would serve merely as the capstone of the standard model of particle physics, which describes the workings of electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces. the standard model, because it excludes gravity, is an incomplete account of reality; it is like a theory of human nature that excludes sex. even kaku has called the standard model "rather ugly" and "a theory that only a mother could love." our best theory of gravity is still general relativity, which does not mesh mathematically with the quantum field theories that comprise the standard model. over the past few decades, theorists have become increasingly obsessed with finding a unified theory, a "theory of everything" that wraps all of nature's forces into one tidy package. hearing all the hoopla about the higgs, the public might understandably assume that it represents a crucial step toward a unified theory-and perhaps at least tentative confirmation of the existence of strings, branes, hyperspaces, multiverses and all the other fantastical eidolons that kaku, stephen hawking, brian greene and other unification enthusiasts tout in their bestsellers. but the higgs doesn't take us any closer to a unified theory than climbing a tree would take me to the moon. as i've pointed out previously , string theory, loop-space theory and other popular candidates for a unified theory postulate phenomena far too minuscule to be detected by any existing or even conceivable (except in a sci-fi way) experiment. obtaining the kind of evidence of a string or loop that we have for, say, the top quark would require building an accelerator as big as the milky way. kaku asserted that finding the higgs "is not enough. what is needed is a genuine theory of everything, which can simply and beautifully unify all the forces of the universe into a single coherent whole-a goal sought by einstein for the last 30 years of his life." he insisted that we are at "the beginning, not the end of physics. the adventure continues." maybe. but i'm not hopeful. whether or not physicists find the goddamn particle, the quest for unification, which has given physics its glitter over the past half century, looks increasingly like a dead end. the long now foundation, a nonprofit that encourages long-term thinking, asked a bunch of people to make bets about trends in science, technology and other realms of culture. i bet kaku $1,000 that by the year 2020, "no one will have won a nobel prize for work on superstring theory, membrane theory or some other unified theory describing all the forces of nature." (lee "loop space" smolin was my original counter-bettor but backed out at the last minute, the big chicken.) kaku and i each put up $1,000 in advance, which the long now foundation keeps in escrow. if civilization-or more importantly, the long now foundation-still exists in 2020, it will give $2,000 to a charity designated by me (the nature conservancy) or kaku (national peace action). in defending my bet, i stated: "the dream of a unified theory, which some evangelists call a 'theory of everything,' will never be entirely abandoned. but i predict that over the next twenty years, fewer smart young physicists will be attracted to an endeavor that has vanishingly little hope of an empirical payoff. most physicists will come to accept that nature might not share our passion for unity. physicists have already produced theories-newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, general relativity, nonlinear dynamics-that work extraordinarily well in certain domains, and there is no reason why there should be a single theory that accounts for all the forces of nature. the quest for a unified theory will come to be seen not as a branch of science, which tells us about the real world, but as a kind of mathematical theology." i added, however-and this is both mawkish tripe and the truth-that "i would be delighted to lose this bet." image by mark evans, courtesy wikimedia commons. about the author: every week, john horgan takes a puckish, provocative look at breaking science. a former staff writer at scientific american, he is the author of four books, including the end of science (addison wesley, 1996) and the end of war (mcsweeney's books, january 2012). follow on twitter prometheus asks, is a culture as stupid as ours ready to create new life?' href=''> the life engineers: prometheus asks, is a culture as stupid as ours ready to create new life? ancient tartar, other dental clues reveal unexpected diet of early human relative #sciamblogs tuesday - citizen science, new source of stem cells, real reptile evolution, lindau nobel meeting, and more. music of the spheres: kepler data become "six-planet sonata" [video] the higgs, sterile neutrinos and spintronics: lindau nobel laureate meeting, day 2 rare photos of a baby pigeon in brooklyn do you have an existing scientificamerican.com account? no, i would like to create a new account with my scientific american is a trademark of scientific american, inc., used with permission

T	new particle found, consistent with higgs boson - wsj.com
C	environment & science updated july 4, 2012, 4:06 p.m. et british physicist peter higgs arrives wednesday for the opening of the seminar near geneva, switzerland. u.s. scientists released fresh data bolstering the case for the existence of the higgs boson, a long-sought particle crucial to scientists' current understanding of how the universe is built. gautam naik has details on lunch break. scientists said they found a subatomic particle resembling the long-elusive higgs boson, a landmark discovery that could explain why particles have mass and, by extension, why stars, planets and all other objects in the universe exist at all. on wednesday morning, hundreds of scientists assembled at the european laboratory cern in geneva and many more tuned in to a live webcast to hear how fresh data from the large hadron collider had conclusively revealed the existence of a higgs-like particle. an undated handout graphic distributed on july 4, 2012 by the european organization for nuclear research in geneva shows a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision measured in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experience in the search for the higgs boson. the cern announcement follows one made on monday by physicists at fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, near chicago, which independently bolstered the case for the existence of the higgs boson. however, the u.s. data didn't offer anywhere near the high level of statistical certainty required by physicists to claim a formal discovery. the higgs finding is expected to throw fresh light on several cosmic mysteries. for example, it could point to different predictions about how much of the universe is dark matter, an enigmatic substance that exerts a gravitational force on entire galaxies the three-story, 6,000-ton cdf detector that records snapshots of particles at the u.s. department of energy's tevatron collider near chicago. scientists at the facility released fresh data bolstering the case for the existence of the higgs boson. in the 1960s, a small number of theorists plugged that gap by dreaming up higgs, which provides a theoretical explanation for how some particles could attain mass. many other scientists pooh-poohed the idea. but experimental results from the giant atom-smashing machine in switzerland have now shown that the daring theoretical leap was, indeed, a worthy one. going back to galileo and kepler, "a 400-year-old quest to describe the world that we can see has now been completed," said gordon kane, professor of physics at the university of michigan. "it completes the standard model." a decade ago, dr. kane wagered $100 that the higgs boson would be found and cosmologist stephen hawking bet that it wouldn't. "i assume he's a gentleman and a scholar and will now pay up," said dr. kane. the university of cambridge confirmed dr. hawking's bet but couldn't provide further details. the particle is named after british physicist peter higgs, one of the theorists who predicted its existence nearly a half-century ago. now 83 years old, the unassuming mr. higgs attended the meeting in geneva. mr. higgs got a standing ovation as he entered the auditorium, and he shed a tear when news of the higgs-like particle was announced. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said. scientists at europe's cern research centre believe they have found one of the basic building blocks of the universe -- a subatomic particle called the higgs boson. the director general of cern told an audience of scientists that the discovery is a milestone in mankind's understanding of nature and has opened up exciting prospects for further revelations in the field. it's been a tough quest, involving thousands of scientists in dozens of countries. no one could predict the mass of the higgs boson, so they had to hunt for it indirectly. this was done at cern by propelling particles to near-light speed and then smashing them together to generate an array of other subatomic particles. the researchers hoped that one such particle would be the higgs itself, though it would almost instantly decay into different combinations of other particles. finding it would then involve looking for statistically significant "excesses" of those particles. the latest experiments at lhc found excesses of this sort in the data. the newly discovered particle is definitely a boson and one of the heaviest such particles to be discovered so far, cern said. it has a mass of between 125-126 gev, or gigaelectronvolts, making it about 134-times heavier than a proton. the higgs offers an answer to how particles might acquire mass. physicists hypothesize that as the universe cooled after the big bang, about 13.7 billion years ago, a force known as the higgs field formed, along with the particle. under this scenario, the higgs field permeates the universe, and any particles that interact with it are given a mass through the higgs boson. the more they interact, the heavier they become. particles that don't interact with the higgs field are left with no mass at all. "it's like a big vat of molasses," said dan green, a physicist at fermilab.

T	fireworks for the physicists: a higgs is found - yahoo! news
C	be grateful america's great historical figures don't talk like scientists. "mr. gorbachev, tear down, modify, or otherwise reduce the architectural footprint of this wall," would not have had the same resonance as the original. patrick henry would have surely been less memorable if he'd asked for liberty, death or an equitable out-of-court settlement. this july 4 however belongs to the scientists -- at least the ones presiding over a packed press conference in geneva convened today by cern, the european center for nuclear research. with cheers echoing and the crowd on its feet, cern researchers announced that they had nabbed the most sought-after particle in the history of modern physics: the higgs boson -- first theorized nearly 50 years ago -- which gives all other particles mass. there's no understating the significance of that: no higgs, no mass; no mass, no you, me or anything else. even so, scientist-speak was the rule of the day -- at least at first. (photos: inside the large hadron collider) "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region of 126 gev," said , the head of one of the two main research teams responsible for the findings. the mass region of 126 gev means 126 billion electron volts -- pretty much a bulls-eye for what the higgs is supposed to weigh; the level of 5 sigma means how certain the scientists are of their results -- and 5 sigma is very, very certain. in geneva today, that was the stuff of a standing ovation -- even as gianotti hastened to urge patience. "a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication," she implored. but never mind the caution.the history-making nature of the moment was undeniable. in the past few years, scientists have been closing in on the higgs with the physics version of a pincer move -- first through experiments at the recently closed tevatron collider outside of chicago, and later with cern's still-new large hadron collider ( lhc ) on the swiss-french border. in both places, the nature of the work has been essentially the same: send protons whizzing in opposite directions along massive, oval shaped tunnels until they reach more than 99.999999% the speed of light. when the two swarms of particles collide, they create a shower of smaller, more elementatry particles, mimicking the conditions of the big bang. in that shower should be the higgs. in the wild -- which is to say everywhere in the primordial universe -- higgs bosons would swarm around other elementary particles and confer them mass. the more energetic the elementary particle, the more bosons it would attract and the more massive it would become. the tevatron had turned up results that pointed to particles in the 115 to 135 gev range -- which strongly suggested a higgs -- and as recently as this week, retrospective analyses of its final runs added to that evidence. but it would be left to the bigger and more precise lhc to seal the deal. and today it did just that. (read "'god particle' found? search for the higgs boson narrows.") "it's an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," said peter higgs , the 83-year-old scottish physicist who headed the team that first came up with the theory in 1964 and was in attendance in geneva today. other scientists, despite themselves, gave way to a similar measured giddiness. "we have found the missing cornerstone of ," said cern director rolf heuer. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." but cern's work is hardly done. missing entirely from all of the high-fives and huzzahs today was a single, tiny word: "the" -- as in the higgs boson has been found. the most the scientists were willing to say is that they found a higgs. the higgs could come in multiple types and multiple masses and energy levels, and while the discovery settles one question, it opens the door to many more. "as a layman, i think we did it," said heuer. "we have a discovery. we have a particle that is consistent with the higgs boson. [this] opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the particle's properties." added cern research director sergio bertolucci: "we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks like we are at the branching point. the discovery of this new particle indicates the path for the future." so cern will stay busy and the lhc, which cost $10 billion to build, will have more to do before it pays for itself. make no mistake though: like the higgs that comes hidden in a shower of particles, there's a word hidden in the shower of equivocation from heuer and bertolucci. that word is a whispered "eureka." the physicists won a very big, very old battle today. so tonight, send up a few fireworks for them; they're surely too modest to do it themselves.

C	john heilprin / the associated press geneva - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle today, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. click image to enlarge british physicist peter higgs, left, arrives to hear about the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin near geneva, switzerland, today. select images available for purchase in the maine today photo store "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said today they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is.

"the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question today. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found."

T	cern physicists say they have discovered a higgs-like boson. - latimes.com
C	have their eyes seen 'god particle'? fermilab finds hints of higgs boson physics blogs hint that long-sought higgs boson is in sight [updated june 21] in a culmination of 50 years of theoretical speculation and three weeks of intense media frenzy, two teams of researchers at the european organization for nuclear research said they had independently discovered evidence for a "higgs-like" boson, the long-sought elementary particle that gives mass to the universe. to thunderous applause from a standing-room-only crowd of physicists and journalists gathered in a large auditorium at cern, as the organization is generally called -- as well as from other groups of physicists around the world watching by webcast -- the leaders of the two teams said they had definitely observed a boson, that it is higgs boson, and that it might be the higgs boson that has been the subject of their frantic search. whichever it is, the discovery is "very, very significant," said physicist joe incandela of uc santa barbara , the lead researcher and spokesman for one of the two teams. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going back to the discovery of quarks, for example." "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," said rolf heuer, cern's director general. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the two teams will now most likely spend many years trying to characterize the properties of the new particle and determine whether it is a unique entity or just one of several different forms of the higgs boson. if there proves to be one and only one higgs boson, its discovery would provide confirmation of the so-called standard model of physics. if there are more than one form, then theorists might have to develop a revised model of how the universe works. quantum theory says that the universe is made of two types of elementary particles, fermions and bosons. fermions are matter, like the electron or the proton. bosons are energy and can transmit forces, like the photon. in 1964, two groups of three theorists each proposed that the universe is pervaded by a molasses-like field, now called the higgs field. as fermions pass through the field, they acquire mass. without the field, the universe would literally fall apart; even atoms would no longer exist. one of the physicists, peter higgs of the university of edinburgh, predicted that if this field were hit by the right amount of energy, it would produce a unique particle, which came to be known as the higgs boson. higgs was present at the cern announcement wednesday and said afterward that, "for me, it is an incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime." in his 1993 book, "the god particle: if the universe is the answer, what is the question?" nobel laureate leon lederman, head of the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia , ill., half-jokingly coined the term god particle because the higgs boson is so crucial to the existence of the universe. the phrase took hold among the public, but has never been very popular with physicists. theory predicted that the higgs boson should be very heavy, but not precisely how heavy. to produce heavy particles requires large amounts of energy, and most early accelerators could not achieve them, although researchers using the tevatron at fermilab last week said they had seen hints of the higgs boson. the $10 billion large hadron collider at cern was constructed in large part to produce the high energies required. protons are whipped around the 17-mile ring on the border of france and switzerland at relativistic speeds (near the speed of light), colliding with each other in detection chambers operated by two teams, one called atlas and one called cms. the teams have sifted through more than 800 trillion collisions looking for the higgs. but detecting a higgs boson is not easy. its lifetime is so short that it cannot be observed directly. instead, researchers can only see its breakdown products, and that is where the uncertainty comes in. some of the particle interactions that would be produced by a higgs disintegration could potentially be produced from other sources as well -- which is why the teams had to look at so many collisions. ultimately, the cms team said they had identified a boson with a mass of 125.3 billion electron volts, about 100 times the mass of a proton. the atlas team said they had seen a mass of 126 billion electron volts. both observations are now at what researchers call the five-sigma level, which means that there is only about one chance in 3.5 million that the results are produced by chance. that is the level of certainty researchers generally require before announcing the "discovery" of a particle. the large hadron collider has been running for only two years, and only at about half of its maximum theoretical power. it was scheduled to be shut down in october for two years of maintenance, but heuer said it will now run until the end of the year so that the teams can gather more data to more precisely characterize the new particle. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. comments are filtered for language and registration is required. the times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy. readers may report inappropriate comments by clicking the report abuse link next to a comment. here are the full erskine: fans' ideas on improving dodger stadium" width="187" height="105" class="headlinethumb" /> kenneth turan reviews 'magic mike' starring channing tatum, alex pettyfer, matth

T	cern physicists say they have discovered a higgs-like boson. - latimes.com
C	graphic: how the large hadron collider works in a culmination of 50 years of theoretical speculation and three weeks of intense media frenzy, two teams of researchers at the european organization for nuclear research said they had independently discovered evidence for a "higgs-like" boson, the long-sought elementary particle that gives mass to the universe. to thunderous applause from a standing-room-only crowd of physicists and journalists gathered in a large auditorium at cern, as the organization is generally called -- as well as from other groups of physicists around the world watching by webcast -- the leaders of the two teams said they had definitely observed a boson, that it is higgs boson, and that it might be the higgs boson that has been the subject of their frantic search. whichever it is, the discovery is "very, very significant," said physicist joe incandela of uc santa barbara , the lead researcher and spokesman for one of the two teams. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going back to the discovery of quarks, for example." "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," said rolf heuer, cern's director general.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle'
C	geneva - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson -- popularly known as the "god particle" -- that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself -- an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle -- a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, `"what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams -- joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists -- each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s -- part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs -- that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson -- not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything -- we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. will offer a fresh look at all the day's headlines in the valley.

T	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle scientists at the cern research centre in switzerland reveal they have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson link to this video there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simple proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: "this is sensational news and quite brilliant science. without doubt, cern has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level. i have waited over 20 years for this moment and am thrilled by the news. the excitement will continue now, as we all try to figure out just how this thing behaves." john ellis, who has worked at cern since the 1970s, said the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. "now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? "the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter." "we're not certain, but i'd be willing to bet the house this turns out to be some sort of higgs particle," said joe incandela, spokesperson for the cms collaboration. higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle scientists at the cern research centre in switzerland reveal they have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson higgs boson: us physicists find strongest evidence yet of 'god particle' why the higgs particle hunt was always going to be a waiting game strong hints of the higgs boson from tevatron particle collider in us higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle follow all the top science stories of the day on twitter quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

"it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: "this is sensational news and quite brilliant science. without doubt, cern has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level. i have waited over 20 years for this moment and am thrilled by the news. the excitement will continue now, as we all try to figure out just how this thing behaves." john ellis, who has worked at cern since the 1970s, said the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. "now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? "the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter." "we're not certain, but i'd be willing to bet the house this turns out to be some sort of higgs particle," said joe incandela, spokesperson for the cms collaboration. higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle @lecanardnoir: i would also just like to point out that i am not a middle class twat from tring. quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

T	physicists discover 'higgs-like' particle - upi.com
C	geneva, switzerland, july 4 (upi) -- physicists in switzerland said wednesday they discovered a subatomic particle that could be key to understanding why elementary particles have mass. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, director general of cern in geneva, told the new york times wednesday in a telephone interview. the discovery -- which also could be vital to understanding how the universe began -- is "a historic milestone," heuer said. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis , a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story -- more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a new york university theorist, told the times. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." some physicists are calling the discovery a "higgs-like" particle, the times said, stopping short of saying it was higgs boson, known as the "god particle," the final missing ingredient in the standard model of particle physics. under the standard model, which ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible demonstration of an invisible force field that pervades space and gives otherwise mass-less elementary particles mass, the times said. without the higgs field, or something like it, physicists said there would be neither atoms nor life.

T	cern physicists say they have discovered a higgs-like boson. - latimes.com
C	have their eyes seen 'god particle'? fermilab finds hints of higgs boson physics blogs hint that long-sought higgs boson is in sight [updated june 21] in a culmination of 50 years of theoretical speculation and three weeks of intense media frenzy, two teams of researchers at the european organization for nuclear research said they had independently discovered evidence for a "higgs-like" boson, the long-sought elementary particle that gives mass to the universe. to thunderous applause from a standing-room-only crowd of physicists and journalists gathered in a large auditorium at cern, as the organization is generally called -- as well as from other groups of physicists around the world watching by webcast -- the leaders of the two teams said they had definitely observed a boson, that it is higgs boson, and that it might be the higgs boson that has been the subject of their frantic search. whichever it is, the discovery is "very, very significant," said physicist joe incandela of uc santa barbara , the lead researcher and spokesman for one of the two teams. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going back to the discovery of quarks, for example." "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," said rolf heuer, cern's director general. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the two teams will now most likely spend many years trying to characterize the properties of the new particle and determine whether it is a unique entity or just one of several different forms of the higgs boson. if there proves to be one and only one higgs boson, its discovery would provide confirmation of the so-called standard model of physics. if there are more than one form, then theorists might have to develop a revised model of how the universe works. quantum theory says that the universe is made of two types of elementary particles, fermions and bosons. fermions are matter, like the electron or the proton. bosons are energy and can transmit forces, like the photon. in 1964, two groups of three theorists each proposed that the universe is pervaded by a molasses-like field, now called the higgs field. as fermions pass through the field, they acquire mass. without the field, the universe would literally fall apart; even atoms would no longer exist. one of the physicists, peter higgs of the university of edinburgh, predicted that if this field were hit by the right amount of energy, it would produce a unique particle, which came to be known as the higgs boson. higgs was present at the cern announcement wednesday and said afterward that, "for me, it is an incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime." in his 1993 book, "the god particle: if the universe is the answer, what is the question?" nobel laureate leon lederman, head of the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia , ill., half-jokingly coined the term god particle because the higgs boson is so crucial to the existence of the universe. the phrase took hold among the public, but has never been very popular with physicists. theory predicted that the higgs boson should be very heavy, but not precisely how heavy. to produce heavy particles requires large amounts of energy, and most early accelerators could not achieve them, although researchers using the tevatron at fermilab last week said they had seen hints of the higgs boson. the $10 billion large hadron collider at cern was constructed in large part to produce the high energies required. protons are whipped around the 17-mile ring on the border of france and switzerland at relativistic speeds (near the speed of light), colliding with each other in detection chambers operated by two teams, one called atlas and one called cms. the teams have sifted through more than 800 trillion collisions looking for the higgs. but detecting a higgs boson is not easy. its lifetime is so short that it cannot be observed directly. instead, researchers can only see its breakdown products, and that is where the uncertainty comes in. some of the particle interactions that would be produced by a higgs disintegration could potentially be produced from other sources as well -- which is why the teams had to look at so many collisions. ultimately, the cms team said they had identified a boson with a mass of 125.3 billion electron volts, about 100 times the mass of a proton. the atlas team said they had seen a mass of 126 billion electron volts. both observations are now at what researchers call the five-sigma level, which means that there is only about one chance in 3.5 million that the results are produced by chance. that is the level of certainty researchers generally require before announcing the "discovery" of a particle. the large hadron collider has been running for only two years, and only at about half of its maximum theoretical power. it was scheduled to be shut down in october for two years of maintenance, but heuer said it will now run until the end of the year so that the teams can gather more data to more precisely characterize the new particle. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. we should've built the superconducting supercollider. then, the boson could've been discovered here, instead of at cern. brian c. at 8:57 am july 04, 2012 yes indeed. makes me think twice about some stuff. yankessrule1865 at 8:54 am july 04, 2012 the pure quest for knowledge unfettered by the base desire to turn a fast buck. this is what the human species should be about. bravo to every single person involved at cern, fermilab and many labs around the world who chewed on the data these great people and those great institutions produced. the lhc is this generation's pyramid and we should all feel a sense of pride. comments are filtered for language and registration is required. the times makes no guarantee of comments' factual accuracy. readers may report inappropriate comments by clicking the report abuse link next to a comment. here are the full erskine: fans' ideas on improving dodger stadium" width="187" height="105" class="headlinethumb" /> - varsity times insider 07/04/2012, 8:30 a.m. - l.a. times - california | local news kenneth turan reviews 'magic mike' starring channing tatum, alex pettyfer, matth

C	geneva - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometre underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. copyright class action">settlement of canadian copyright class action

T	cern scientists find new subatomic particle; could be higgs | smartplanet
C	rss cern scientists find new subatomic particle; could be higgs laura shin | july 4, 2012, 7:46 am pdt in one of the biggest physics breakthroughs of the last century, physicists at cern, one of the world's largest physics labs, announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle. although they'll need further study to determine exactly what it is, it looks so far to be the higgs boson, the subatomic particle that was first proposed 45 years ago and has been the subject of decades of theorizing and research. what the 'god particle' is and what it means for physics called the "god particle" (and, jokingly, "the goddamn particle" due to its elusiveness), the higgs boson is not only significant in itself: its confirmation, as the new york times report , "reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry." according to the standard model, the prevailing theory in physics for the last 40 years, the higgs boson is the only physical evidence of an invisible force field or "cosmic molasses," as the times calls it, that permeates space and gives mass to elementary particles that would otherwise be massless. without this "higgs field," life would not be possible, atoms would not exist and all elementary forms of matter would zip around at the speed of light. it was first proposed by a team of six scientists who theorized that this cosmic molasses was normally invisible but would produce its own quantum particle if it was hit hard enough by the right amount of energy. that particle, the higgs boson, would fall apart within a millionth of a second and its weight was not known - both factors making it hard to find. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, was on the team of scientists to propose the existence of the higgs. as he entered geneva headquarters of cern (the european organization for nuclear research), where the discovery was announced, professor higgs was given a standing ovation. how scientists discovered the new particle the large hadron collider at cern is the world's largest and most expensive particle accelerator. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas and the other cms - operate giant detectors inside of it, and then analyze the debris left over after colliding protons into each other. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle, but the coincidence could have been due to a statistical fluke. since then, the teams stepped up their work with the lhc, doubling the total number of collisions it has performed since it first began operations two years ago. eventually, they determined that the likelihood coincidence in their experiments was due to random chance was one in 3.5 million, which meant that it passed muster in physics for a significant discovery. the new particle's mass is about 125.3 billion electron volts, according to cms, and 126, according to atlas. dr. rolf heuer, the director general of cern, decided on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he told the times , "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." initially, the discovery was to be announced at a major conference in melbourne that started wednesday. ultimately, the cern council decided to make the historic announcement at the lab itself. a 'rock concert' or 'football game' for physicists three weeks ago, buzz began to build around the potential discovery, as the two teams raced to analyze 800 trillion proton-proton collisions of the last two years. #higgsrumors became a trending hashtag on twitter, and an iphone game called "agent higgs" came out. when the five surviving members of the team that first proposed the higgs boson were invited to geneva for the cern news conference, speculation reached a frenzy. the two presentations by cern spokespeople dr. fabiola giannotti and dr. joe incandela were constantly interrupted by applause, and attendees described the atmosphere to the times as being like a football game or a rock concert. dr. higgs himself wiped a tear from his eye after the presentations and said, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." cern: we'll find that higgs boson even if it take 4 trillion electronvolts in the unlikely event that laura has a professional or financial relationship with a company she writes about, it will be prominently disclosed.

T	new subatomic particle could be higgs boson
C	after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists have said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) on wednesday after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle back in 1964, expressed joy. standard model "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. mathematical quirk over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp news agency. creative commons attribution-noncommercial-noderivs 3.0 unported license

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle | world news | the guardian
C	john heilprin associated press= geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. india's 'child picasso' puts on his goggles and takes aim at the canvas syria crisis: turkey finds bodies of downed pilots - live updates mystery of the l'oreal heir, 'mr nicolas' and the envelopes stuffed with euros antidote by oliver burkeman ?9.99

T	our place in the world: 839. a new particle could be physics' holy grail
C	by denise overbye, the new york times , july 4, 2012 british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern headquarters today aspen, colo. - physicists working at cern 's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. the british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern's headquarters on wednesday. "i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "i was really impressed. it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins!" at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads - will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr. incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr. incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart. "i believe it now; i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy - einstein showed they are the same - that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti said at one point: "why are you applauding? i'm not done yet. this is just beginning. there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviors and channels. "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons; and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr. higgs of the university of edinburgh, was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london, carl hagen of university of rochester, dr. guralnik of brown university, and francois englert and the late robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr. heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of the year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing some its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgs-like fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an anti-gravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe, and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said dr. tonelli. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillions of proton collisions, will tell. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team at cern wrote about the higgs, "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time."

"it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "i was really impressed. it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins!" at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads - will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart. "i believe it now; i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy - einstein showed they are the same - that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr incandela's and dr gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr gianotti said at one point: "why are you applauding? i'm not done yet. this is just beginning. there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviours and channels. "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons; and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr higgs of the university of edinburgh was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london, carl hagen of university of rochester, dr guralnik of brown university, and francois englert and the late robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odourless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of large hadron collider. both dr heuer and dr gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of the year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing some its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgs-like fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an anti-gravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe, and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said dr tonelli. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillions of proton collisions, will tell. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team at cern wrote about the higgs, "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time."

C	geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." watch: what is the higgs boson? the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, `"what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found."

T	a closer look at the god particle - higgs boson | 9news.com
C	kusa - due to the extreme dry conditions jefferson and douglas counties banned ... kusa - as the north american monsoon appears to be taking shape, colorado is ... london - the final touches are underway for the london summer games. we are ... st. louis (ap) - jeff francis worked five solid innings before the colorado ... berlin (ap) -- scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature.

T	physicists find elusive higgs boson, seen as key to universe - nytimes.com
C	aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the fabrice coffrini/agence france-presse - getty images the british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern's headquarters on wednesday. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which costs $10 billion to build only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power.

T	higgs boson 'discovered', existence of mass in universe explained by 'god particle' - forbes
C	cern in switzerland have confirmed the existence of the elusive higgs boson-or something very much like it. "the cms experiments at cern today presented their latest results in the search for the long-sought higgs boson . both experiments see strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (gev)," cern has announced on their website . "the experiments found hints of the new particle by analysing trillions of proton-proton collisions from the standard model of particle physics predicts that a higgs boson would decay into different particles - which the lhc experiments then detect." atlas and cms have characterized "the level of significance of the result as 5 sigma on the scale that particle physicists use to describe the certainty of a discovery. one sigma means the results could be random fluctuations in the data, 3 sigma counts as an observation and a 5-sigma result is a discovery." business practitioners of 6 sigma methodology will see that this is (really) close to certainty, but no cigar quite yet. for half a century, physicists have had this problem. the standard model , developed in the 1960s, so elegantly describes so many aspects of the physical universe-but it leaves out 96% of the mass. big problem. so it has been job #1 to find the missing mass-to describe a mechanism by which particles acquire mass. at higher and higher levels of energy, the different forces of the universe-gravity, electromagnetism, the weak and strong forces-unify like in the first instants after the big bang, and it is possible to "see" phenomena that are too volatile to observe in everyday life. the standard model predicts that one of those volatile things is the higgs boson, a particle (or class of particles) that are "gobbled up" by other particles, giving them mass. [note: massive oversimplification! ] the pursuit of the missing mass, and the elusive bosons, has been accomplished with the use of higher and higher-powered particle accelerators, all the way up to the present lhc at cern. in its first year of operation, it would seem that the lhc has succeeded at manifesting a particle that has the characteristics of the higgs. years of study are ahead for scientists at cern to confirm exactly what they have seen. is it the "simple" higgs predicted by the model, or something more exotic that points to other avenues of research? for the moment, its discovery does firm up what we know about mass in physics, which is a big deal. in the video (above) just released by cern, theoretical physicist john ellis explains the concept of the higgs field, "empty space is like a medium, and as particles travel through this medium, some of them interact with it, some of them don't interact with it. the ones that do interact with this medium, they acquire masses. the ones that pass through without interacting, those are our massless particles." ellis compares this to an endless field of snow, with different particles either gliding on the top (like fast, "massless" skiers) or sinking down into it (like a person walking in deep powder). philip tanedo provides technical but lucid explanations of all of this (complete with user-friendly diagrams) at his wonderful why we expect a higgs boson." why does this matter? because this hierarchical asymmetry of particles that is explained by the existence of the higgs field is something we do, indeed, experience in everyday life. look at the power law distribution of wealth, ideas or popularity in society and you will see the same mechanisms at play. some entities-from people to products, companies to concepts-acquire mass, influence and prestige while other go unnoticed. these "massive particles" emit lot of light (i.e.: buzz) social media, twitter in particular, has been really useful in making this process concrete, and companies like klout and others have tried to turn this "big data" into usable data-with mixed results. on a more philosophical level-and the reason why the higgs has been known as the "god particle"-it makes a difference to our state of mind believing that most of the mass in the universe is explained as opposed to 96% random. there are still the mysteries of dark matter, dark energy and antimatter to sort out, but a higgs universe is less of a godless anarchy than one without it. a proton-proton collision event in the cms experiment producing two high-energy photons (red towers). this is what we would expect to see from the decay of a higgs boson but it is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. ? cern 2012 i am a content strategist, designer and developer. i use my experience as a magazine art director and web editor to help publishers, marketers, non-profits and self-branded individuals tell their stories in words and images. i follow all of the technologies that relate to the content business and try to identify the opportunities and pitfalls that these technologies pose. at the same time i am immersed in certain sectors through my content practice and am always looking to find connections between the worlds of neurology, economics, entertainment, travel and mobile technology. i live near the appropriately-scaled metropolis of portland, maine, and occasionally write about the creative economy in portland in wingandko.com . the author is a forbes contributor. the opinions expressed are those of the writer. amazon cloud goes down friday night, taking netflix, instagram and pinterest with it will october's iphone 5 look like this? is this how apple dreams become our realities? android payback: apple to cut google out of stunning new 3d maps app in ios6

T	scientists in geneva discover particle, stop short of calling it mystery higgs boson | nj.com
C	epa/denis balibouse participants applaud after a presentation results during a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin near geneva, switzerland, 04 july 2012. scientists seeking to explain the origins of matter said wednesday they discovered a particle that may support a decades-old theory of physics, bringing people closer to understanding unseen parts of the universe. the observed particle is the heaviest boson ever found, said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the experiments at cern, the european organization for nuclear research, at a seminar wednesday at its geneva headquarters. scientists stopped short of claiming the particle is the elusive higgs boson, a theoretical particle that could explain where mass comes from. "as a layman, i think i would say 'we have it,'" said rolf-dieter heuer, director of cern, at a press conference in geneva. it will take at least three to four years of research to fully understand the properties of the observed particle, heuer said. the announcement brings humankind closer to answering a millennia-old question that the ancient greeks wrestled with: what is matter made of? the particle is a key to the standard model, a theory explaining how the universe is built, and its existence would help scientists gain a better understanding of how galaxies hold together. it also could open a door to exploring other parts of physics such as superparticles or dark matter that telescopes can't detect. the new boson "sings and dances like" the theoretical particle, said pauline gagnon, a researcher on the atlas set of experiments in geneva, in an interview in melbourne, where she was attending the bi-annual international conference on high energy physics. "there is no doubt it comes from a different signal, different channels, with different experiments. we just need in the next few months with more data to ascertain exactly what are the properties of this particle to see if it is exactly the standard model higgs boson or some variation of it." particle physics is the study of the elemental building blocks that make up matter. these particles, with names such as quark, fermion, lepton and boson, can't be subdivided. they exist and interact within several unseen "fields" that permeate the universe. the field that generates mass for objects is named for british physicist peter higgs, who in the 1960s was one of the first scientists to outline a working theory on how elemental particles achieve mass. higgs was one of four of the theorists attending wednesday's meeting in geneva. he wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were presented. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," higgs said in geneva. in a statement, he said he would be "asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." higgs wrote that some particles - such as photons, the basic unit of light - don't interact with the higgs field, and thus don't achieve mass. most others do. to put it another way, if the higgs field were a hollywood party, a photon would be the unknown actor who hurries through without gaining a bit of interest from others in the room. other particles would be more like angelina jolie, drawing crowds of hangers-on as they move through the party. it gets increasingly harder to stop such a cluster from moving forward and more difficult to get it moving again once it's stopped, meeting one definition of mass. scientists are trying to prove the existence of the higgs field by displaying a physical effect for the higgs boson, a particle that lives for less than a trillionth of a second and is an excitation, or force, within the higgs field. providing indirect evidence that the higgs field exists will allow scientists to dig even deeper into the secrets of our existence, said mark wise, a professor of physics at california institute of technology. "in some sense, this is the beginning," wise said of finding the boson. "because we want to know all its properties." the data presented wednesday are the latest from the $10.5 billion large hadron collider, a 27-kilometer (17-mile) circumference particle accelerator buried on the border of france and switzerland. cern has 10,000 scientists working on the project, in which billions of subatomic particles are hurled at each other at velocities approaching the speed of light. the collider will provide more data later this year, giving scientists a more complete picture of the observed new particle. researchers will try to determine whether it is a higgs boson, the particle predicted by the standard model. "very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle," said themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, said in a statement. "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." a more exotic version of the higgs particle could help scientists understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains obscure, since observable matter only represents 4 percent of the total, cern said. to declare the boson is discovered, physicists use the statistical standard of "five sigma," meaning that there should only be a 1 in 3.4 million chance that a sighting would be due to chance. the observations of the new particle have a five-sigma level of significance, incandela said. "the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks," he said.

C	story created: wed jul 4, 2012 5:19 am story updated: wed jul 4, 2012 5:19 am geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed.

T	what is the question ? spoiler alert :: cern discovers *higgs-like* boson . [4 july 2012 fireworks]
C	graphic: how the large hadron collider works in a culmination of 50 years of theoretical speculation and three weeks of intense media frenzy, two teams of researchers at the european organization for nuclear research said they had independently discovered evidence for a "higgs-like" boson, the long-sought elementary particle that gives mass to the universe. to thunderous applause from a standing-room-only crowd of physicists and journalists gathered in a large auditorium at cern, as the organization is generally called -- as well as from other groups of physicists around the world watching by webcast -- the leaders of the two teams said they had definitely observed a boson, that it is higgs boson, and that it might be the higgs boson that has been the subject of their frantic search. whichever it is, the discovery is "very, very significant," said physicist joe incandela of uc santa barbara , the lead researcher and spokesman for one of the two teams. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going back to the discovery of quarks, for example." "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," said rolf heuer, cern's director general. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the two teams will now most likely spend many years trying to characterize the properties of the new particle and determine whether it is a unique entity or just one of several different forms of the higgs boson. if there proves to be one and only one higgs boson, its discovery would provide confirmation of the so-called standard model of physics. if there are more than one form, then theorists might have to develop a revised model of how the universe works. quantum theory says that the universe is made of two types of elementary particles, fermions and bosons. fermions are matter, like the electron or the proton. bosons are energy and can transmit forces, like the photon. in 1964, two groups of three theorists each proposed that the universe is pervaded by a molasses-like field, now called the higgs field. as fermions pass through the field, they acquire mass. without the field, the universe would literally fall apart; even atoms would no longer exist. one of the physicists, peter higgs of the university of edinburgh, predicted that if this field were hit by the right amount of energy, it would produce a unique particle, which came to be known as the higgs boson. higgs was present at the cern announcement wednesday and said afterward that, "for me, it is an incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime." in his 1993 book, "the god particle: if the universe is the answer, what is the question?" nobel laureate leon lederman, head of the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia , ill., half-jokingly coined the term god particle because the higgs boson is so crucial to the existence of the universe. the phrase took hold among the public, but has never been very popular with physicists. theory predicted that the higgs boson should be very heavy, but not precisely how heavy. to produce heavy particles requires large amounts of energy, and most early accelerators could not achieve them, although researchers using the tevatron at fermilab last week said they had seen hints of the higgs boson. the $10 billion large hadron collider at cern was constructed in large part to produce the high energies required. protons are whipped around the 17-mile ring on the border of france and switzerland at relativistic speeds (near the speed of light), colliding with each other in detection chambers operated by two teams, one called atlas and one called cms. the teams have sifted through more than 800 trillion collisions looking for the higgs. but detecting a higgs boson is not easy. its lifetime is so short that it cannot be observed directly. instead, researchers can only see its breakdown products, and that is where the uncertainty comes in. some of the particle interactions that would be produced by a higgs disintegration could potentially be produced from other sources as well -- which is why the teams had to look at so many collisions. ultimately, the cms team said they had identified a boson with a mass of 125.3 billion electron volts, about 100 times the mass of a proton. the atlas team said they had seen a mass of 126 billion electron volts. both observations are now at what researchers call the five-sigma level, which means that there is only about one chance in 3.5 million that the results are produced by chance. that is the level of certainty researchers generally require before announcing the "discovery" of a particle. the large hadron collider has been running for only two years, and only at about half of its maximum theoretical power. it was scheduled to be shut down in october for two years of maintenance, but heuer said it will now run until the end of the year so that the teams can gather more data to more precisely characterize the new particle. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. since nobody can answer either question, what made the particle and what made god, we can only look to facts to give us answers. it doesnt matter if every experiment and finding that science experiences is worthless or not, i dont need a higgs boson, or a any bosons to know that all knowing, all powerful and all loving creators arent likely to be homophobic sexist bullies! devientgenie 7:72--thou can tripith and fall in any squasre mile in this country and hit the ground where a religious claiming pedophile hath walked before. the consensus is god is our father, what if science was a father too. one is here everyday making our lives better thru technology, and one is a dead beat no show father who is playing annie with his tomorrow, tommorrow, i'll see ya tomorrow routine! the sad consensus is, no, not zeus or aphrodite, but a homophobic sexist who threatens punishment if you dont believe and kiss his up to him! i'd like to give a big higgs boson shout out to science....we love you....thank you for proving your point without crucifing anyone, and a big thanks to our sponsors, check and mate! science wins!

C	0.0 (0 votes) geneva (ap) -- to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, `"what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. become a member sign up on kvoa.com for newsletters, exclusive deals, and more! get news, weather and more on your smartphone and tablet!

((ap photo/keystone/martial trezzini)) and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs-think matter and anti-matter-but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed-or cloud-computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy-used in the fight against cancer-have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. note: our article pages automatically refresh every ten minutes. we cannot change this. if you start writing your comment on this page, please refresh the page before you do so - this will reset the ten-minute counter use the "report abuse" link when necessary (you don't have to be a member, or be logged in) rain helps firefighters at waldo canyon fire, now 80 percent contained one more day at 95 degrees or higher likely before denver cools off ticketing bicyclists who ignore traffic laws, setting up traffic checkpoints on scheduled "safety-enforcement days." is this an appropriate use of police resources? yes. bicyclists rarely follow traffic rules, endangering both themselves and others on the road. it's time to crack down. all contents copyright 2012 the denver post or other copyright holders. all rights reserved.

T	3 questions: physicist christoph paus discusses newly discovered particle | machines like us
C	by steve bradt story source mit professor of physics christoph paus dozens of mit physicists were part of the team that found what might be the higgs boson. what does their discovery mean, and what's next for particle physics? today cern , the european organization for nuclear research, announced the most conclusive evidence yet for the existence of the higgs boson (at 5 sigma ), a long-elusive cornerstone of the standard model of physics. this subatomic particle, first postulated in the 1960s and widely sought ever since, is thought to underlie the origins of mass. more than 50 mit physicists and students were part of the cms (compact muon solenoid) experiment at cern's large hadron collider, representing that experiment's largest contingent of physicists from any american university. mit professor of physics christoph paus is one of two lead investigators (with albert de roeck of cern) on the cms higgs search, which comprises roughly 500 scientists. paus spoke with mit news about the institute's contribution to this apparent breakthrough in particle physics, as well as the result's significance for our understanding of the universe. q . what are the implications of this newly discovered particle? why should non-physicists care about this? a . the search for the higgs boson at the large hadron collider is the culmination of research over the last half-century. this particle is inextricably intertwined with an incredibly mundane-sounding question: "what is the physics of motion?" motion ties together the fundamental concepts of space, time and mass: space and time are linked through velocity, while mass is the resistance to changes in velocity. explaining motion was important enough that aristotle sought to do so, and his answer stood for almost 2,000 years. but penetrating more deeply into the mysteries of motion led to the revolutions of galileo, newton and einstein. in this same tradition, the higgs boson holds the promise of beginning to finally elucidate the fundamental origins of mass. we cannot yet say whether the phenomenon we are reporting today is indeed the higgs; that will take much more data to determine. but so far it fulfills our search criteria, and if confirmed, will set an important milestone in our understanding of nature. should we be observing something other than the higgs - well, that may be even more important.

C	geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found."

T	a closer look at the higgs boson - dallas news | myfoxdfw.com
C	berlin (ap) - scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. kdfw fox 4 400 n. griffin street dallas, texas 75202 main station directory: (214) 720-4444 news fax:

T	european scientists may have found the 'god particle' :: editor's blog at wral tech wire
C	by bloomberg cern, the european organization for nuclear research, says its researchers observed a particle that may be the higgs boson, a theoretical particle that could explain where mass comes from. cern uncovered a new boson, joe incandela, spokesman for one of the research institute's experiments, said at a seminar at its geneva headquarters. scientists stopped short of claiming the particle is the elusive higgs boson, the so-called god particle created at the beginning of the universe. in a statement on cern's website. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." the announcement brings humankind closer to answering a millennia-old question that the ancient greeks wrestled with: what is matter made of? ( bloomberg news provides q&a about the particle. ) the particle is a missing link in the standard model, a theory explaining how the universe is built, and its existence would help scientists gain a better understanding of how galaxies hold together. it also could open a door to exploring other parts of physics such as superparticles or dark matter that telescopes can't detect. 'sings and dances' the new boson "sings and dances like" the theoretical particle, said pauline gagnon, a researcher on the atlas set of experiments in geneva, in an interview in melbourne, where she was attending the bi-annual international conference on high energy physics. "there is no doubt it comes from a different signal, different channels, with different experiments. we just need in the next few months with more data to ascertain exactly what are the properties of this particle to see if it is exactly the standard model higgs boson or some variation of it."" particle physics is the study of the elemental building blocks that make up matter. these particles, with exotic names like quark, fermion, lepton and boson, can't be subdivided. they exist and interact within several unseen ''fields'' that permeate the universe. the field that generates mass for objects is named for u.k. physicist peter higgs, who in the 1960s was one of the first scientists to outline a working theory on how elemental particles achieve mass. higgs was one of the theorists attending cern's meeting in geneva today. champagne for higgs ''for me, it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," higgs said in geneva. in a statement, he said he would be "asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." higgs wrote that some particles -- such as photons, the basic unit of light -- don't interact with the higgs field, and thus don't achieve mass. most others do. to put it another way, if the higgs field were a hollywood party, a photon would be the unknown actor who hurries through without gaining a bit of interest from others in the room. other particles would be more like angelina jolie, drawing crowds of hangers-on as they move through the party. it gets increasingly harder to stop such a cluster from moving forward and more difficult to get it moving again once it's stopped, meeting one definition of mass. scientists are trying to prove the existence of the higgs field by displaying a physical effect for the higgs boson, a particle that only lives for less than a trillionth of a second and is an excitation, or force, within the higgs field. digging deeper providing indirect evidence the higgs field exists will allow scientists to dig even deeper into the secrets of our existence, said mark wise, a professor of physics at california institute of technology. "in some sense, this is the beginning," wise said of finding the boson. "because we want to know all its properties as well." the data being presented today are the latest from the $10.5 billion large hadron collider, a 27-kilometer (17-mile) circumference particle accelerator buried on the border of france and switzerland. cern has 10,000 scientists working on the project, in which billions of subatomic particles are hurled at each other at velocities approaching the speed of light. the collider will provide the experiments with more data later this year, giving scientists a more complete picture of the observed new particle. researchers will try to determine whether the particle observed is a higgs boson, the particle predicted by the standard model or not. like columbus "very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle," said themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, said in a statement. "for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america." a more exotic version of the higgs particle could help scientists understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains obscure, since observable matter only represents 4 percent of the total, cern said. to declare the boson is discovered, physicists use the statistical standard of "five sigma," meaning that there should only be a 1 in 3.4 million chance that a sighting would be due to chance. the observations of the new particle have a five-sigma level of significance, incandela said. cern director general rolf-dieter heuer has said if its researchers don't find the particle by the end of this year, they will exclude its existence. failing to find the higgs boson would have lent credibility to alternative theories that explain the mechanism that allows particles to have mass. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," heuer said in the cern statement. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe."

"we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics ," rolf heuer , director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela , head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti , head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the " standard model " higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration."

T	a new particle could be physics' holy grail - pittsburgh post-gazette
C	the 911th's reprieve: more work must be done to save the military base business news briefs: rite aid settles suit over unpaid overtime aspen, colo. -- physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond -- everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "i was really impressed. it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins!" at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson -- and there are hints of some already -- could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story -- more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads -- will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each -- one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela -- operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr. incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr. incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart. "i believe it now; i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy -- einstein showed they are the same -- that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti said at one point: "why are you applauding? i'm not done yet. this is just beginning. there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviors and channels. "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons, and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and francois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute, they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr. heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of this year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgslike fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far, the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," dr. tonelli said. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillion proton collisions, will tell.

C	berlin (ap) -- scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature.

C	(cbs/ap) scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. subscribe to this comment thread by email cancel the posting of advertisements, profanity, or personal attacks is prohibited. by using this web site you agree to accept our report offensive content: if you believe this comment is offensive or violates the cbsnews.com terms of use , you can report it below (this will not automatically remove the comment). once reported, our staff will be notified and the comment will be reviewed. offensive: sexually explicit or offensive language advertisements, commercial links, or repetitive posts disruptive posting: flaming or offending other users illegal activities: promote cracked software, or other illegal content e-mail this comment to a friend. e-mail this to: send me a copy of this message note: your e-mail address is used only to let the recipient know who sent the e-mail and in case of transmission error. neither your address nor the recipients's address will be used for any other purpose. invasive species taking over canadian habitats cern scientists announce observation of higgs boson particle

C	associated press geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, `"what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said.

T	new particle could be higgs boson: scientists | otago daily times online news : otago, south island, new zealand & international news
C	scientists at the cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of britain's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and even life. without the higgs particle, the particles that make up the universe would have remained like a soup, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists don't yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as described by the standard model, a variant of the higgs or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, the most exciting. what is the higgs boson? the higgs is the last missing piece of the standard model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found and finding the higgs would validate the model. ruling it out or finding something more exotic would force a rethink on how the universe is put together. scientists believe that in the first billionth of a second after the big bang, the universe was a gigantic soup of particles racing around at the speed of light without any mass to speak of. it was through their interaction with the higgs field that they gained mass and eventually formed the universe. the higgs field is a theoretical and invisible energy field that pervades the whole cosmos. some particles, like the photons that make up light, are not affected by it and therefore have no mass. others find it drags on them as porridge drags on a spoon. picture george clooney (the particle) walking down a street with a gaggle of photographers (the higgs field) clustered around him. an average guy on the same street (a photon) gets no attention from the paparazzi and gets on with his day. the higgs particle is the signature of the field - an eyelash of one of the photographers. the particle is theoretical, first posited in 1964 by six physicists, including briton peter higgs. the search for it only began in earnest in the 1980s, first in fermilab's now mothballed tevatron particle collider near chicago and later in a similar machine at cern, but most intensively since 2010 with the start-up of the european centre's large hadron collider. what is the standard model? the standard model is to physics what the theory of evolution is to biology. it is the best explanation physicists have of how the building blocks of the universe are put together. it describes 12 fundamental particles, governed by four basic forces. but the universe is a big place and the standard model only explains a small part of it. scientists have spotted a gap between what we can see and what must be out there. that gap must be filled by something we don't fully understand, which they have dubbed 'dark matter'. galaxies are also hurtling away from each other faster than the forces we know about suggest they should. this gap is filled by 'dark energy'. this poorly understood pair are believed to make up a whopping 96 percent of the mass and energy of the cosmos. confirming the standard model, or perhaps modifying it, would be a step towards the holy grail of physics - a 'theory of everything' that encompasses dark matter, dark energy and the force of gravity, which the standard model also does not explain. it could also shed light on even more esoteric ideas, such as the possibility of parallel universes. cern spokesman james gillies has said that just as albert einstein's theories enveloped and built on the work of isaac newton, the work being done by the thousands of physicists at cern has the potential to do the same to einstein's work. what is the large hadron collider? the large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator, a 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe that sits in a tunnel 100 metres underground on the swiss/french border. it cost 3 billion euros to build. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around it before smashing into each other to create many millions of particle collisions every second in a recreation of the conditions a fraction of a second after the big bang, when the higgs field is believed to have 'switched on'. the vast amount of data produced is examined by banks of computers. of all the trillions of collisions, very few are just right for revealing the higgs particle. that makes the hunt for the higgs slow, and progress incremental. what is the threshold for proof? to claim a discovery, scientists have set themselves a target for certainty that they call "5 sigma". this means that there is a probability of less than one in a million that their conclusions from the data harvested from the particle accelerator are the result of a statistical fluke. the two teams hunting for the higgs at cern, called atlas and cms, now have twice the amount of data that allowed them to claim 'tantalising glimpses' of the higgs at the end of last year and this could push their results beyond that threshold.

"we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william&mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible.

T	cempaka belanda: higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle
C	'god particle' that gives mass to the universe thought to have been found in large hadron collider, announce scientists guardian.co.uk , ian sample at cern, geneva, wednesday 4 july 2012 a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by the european organisation for nuclear research (cern). photograph: afp/getty images there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , near geneva, home of the large hadron collider, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson , the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics . "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo, a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simplest proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. related articles: higgs boson discovery: now the real work begins factbox: what is the big bang? what is the higgs boson and why is it important?

T	'god particle' likely discovered - british columbia - cbc news
C	updated 'god particle' likely discovered boson could be 'missing cornerstone of particle physics' cern press release (note:cbc does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher in switzerland say they have discovered what could be the long-sought higgs boson , a subatomic particle dubbed the "god particle" because it is believed to have originated during the big bang and helped shape the subatomic particles that make up all matter in the universe. rolf heuer, director of the european centre for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin, switzerland, near the border with france, made the announcement early wednesday, saying that researchers "have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics." he described the discovery as a boson, a wider class of subatomic particle, but stopped short of confirming that it's a higgs boson - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he said. "we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson has been labelled the "god particle" in the mainstream media because of the fundamental questions it could answer about matter and the creation of the universe, and although most physicists avoid using the term they do agree that the higgs boson plays a key role in what is known as the standard model of physics, which describes the particles from which everything in the universe is made and how they interact. theory 1st proposed in 1960s the standard model includes common subatomic particles like electrons and protons along with less familiar ones like muons. the higgs boson is the only one that remains undetected in experiments and is extremely important because it is believed to impart mass to particles. a 2011 proton-proton collision in the compact muon solenoid, or cms, detector within the large hadron collider at cern. four high-energy electrons (green lines and red towers) are observed in the collision, which shows characteristics expected from the decay of a higgs boson but is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. the existence of a higgs boson was first proposed by british physicist peter higgs and his colleagues at edinburgh university in 1964 as a way of explaining how particles gained mass, a property that at first did not seem to fit into the standard model of how electrons and protons interact. higgs proposed that particles gain mass by interacting with a medium that exists everywhere in space and is made up of unseen particles called bosons. higgs's theory does not assign a specific mass to the boson itself but gives a range of values for the potential masses it could have, and it was these values that gave cern scientists a way to detect traces of the particle. the scientists did not spot the particle per se but detected its footprint when observing high-speed collisions of other subatomic particles in two separate experiments conducted with the atlas and cms particle-collision detectors, which detect collisions within cern's large hadron collider . they had a range of values for what the likely mass of the boson is and by knowing the masses of the particles they could detect in the accelerator and analysing the collisions, they were able to detect the likely presence of the boson. the scientists said both particle accelerators detected "strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts." triumf physicists involved in hunt wednesday's announcement follows decades of work and billions of dollars spent on a project that has involved scientists in dozens of countries. to mark the occasion in canada, a few dozen physicists and other experts at triumf, a particle physics lab in vancouver that has been involved with the hunt for the higgs boson, gathered overnight to celebrate . "it's a big day for cern, a big day for international science, and a big day for science in canada," said oliver stelzer-chilton, a physicist at the triumf lab. "but now, we have to come to the bottom of it," he said. "what is nature telling us that this new particle is?"

"positive identification of the new particle's characteristics will take considerable time and data," the cern statement said.

T	physicists discover 'higgs-like' particle - upi.com
C	geneva, switzerland, july 4 (upi) -- physicists in switzerland said wednesday they discovered a subatomic particle that could be key to understanding why elementary particles have mass. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, director general of cern in geneva, told the new york times wednesday in a telephone interview. the discovery -- which also could be vital to understanding how the universe began -- is "a historic milestone," heuer said. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis , a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story -- more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a new york university theorist, told the times. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." some physicists are calling the discovery a "higgs-like" particle, the times said, stopping short of saying it was higgs boson, known as the "god particle," the final missing ingredient in the standard model of particle physics. under the standard model, which ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible demonstration of an invisible force field that pervades space and gives otherwise mass-less elementary particles mass, the times said. without the higgs field, or something like it, physicists said there would be neither atoms nor life. "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads -- will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" if you were thinking, "what's the deal with this higgs boson? and can somebody explain it to me... man suspected of breaking into the graves of johann strauss jr. and johannes brahms and stealing... with newsrooms across the country nearly empty, what are the remaining luckless few forced to work... united press international, inc. all rights reserved. upi.com is your trusted source for world news, top news, science news, health news and current events. we thank you for visiting us and we hope that we will be your daily stop for news updates.

T	cern director: "i think we have it." | the high definite
C	cern director dr. rolf-dieter heuer confirmed the existence of a subatomic particle consistent with the elusive reports: physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. when asked about the discovery, peter higgs (who first predicted the particle's existence almost 50 years ago) replied , "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened. it is very satisfying. for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago."

C	geneva (reuters) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. "nobel prizes all round." higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. end of an era "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein 's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. tillman dominates mariners, leads orioles to 4-2 win in return to majors orioles pitcher chris tillman earns another start -- with a double-a detour baltimore and rebirth - baltimoresun.com - second opinion baltimore police release photo of man sought in may slaying of terrence anderson - baltimore crime beat - baltimoresun.com

C	today, scientists from the cern, the european organisation for nuclear research, announced they had discovered a subatomic particle consistent with the higgs boson. rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, said: "i think we have it." physicists across britain have hailed the discovery as a "major breakthrough", a "triumph" and "truly great moment for science". one compared it to columbus discovering of america, while another used the analogy of the human body, saying the higgs boson was of equivalent importance to the heart. many have now called for professor higgs, now 83, to receive a knighthood, and the team who help develop the theory to be awarded the nobel prize. professor jim al-khalili, professor of physics at the university of surrey, said: "of all the people worthy of a knighthood i cannot think of anyone more deserving right now than peter higgs. "his incredible prediction almost half a century ago of the existence of a new particle that bears his name has turned out to be correct and will surely now revolutionise physics. " speaking from the conference in geneva, gerry guralnik, one of the six physicists who proposed the idea of the higgs boson in 1954, said: "he should be [knighted]. he has made a great contribution to what looks like a great discovery." professor peter higgs listens to the cern announcement in geneva today prof andy parker, from cambridge university, said: "peter higgs is a real gentleman and a great scientist who is certainly worthy of a knighthood.

T	'god particle' unveiled? super-collider scientists declare victory | technology | katu.com - portland news, sports, traffic weather and breaking news - portland, oregon
C	geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." common questions about the higgs boson the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. i'm one of those wet blankets who is afraid of bumbling lab technicians tinkering with the forces of nature that hold our world together. no, i don't have so much faith that they know what they are doing when wandering into realms that they are not familiar with. there has been concern (which i share) that these people will use the lhc to fabricate a small gravitational singularity ( a mini black hole ), and that it will destroy the planet and more. to study a thing, first it must be discovered. that's the course of all science and exploration. police said a passerby found christina harmon, 19, in the roadway near a bus stop on south beavercreek road near south red soils court

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle | theunion.com
C	geneva - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration."

T	discovery, unofficial! higgs boson, 'god particle': new subatomic particle, without it, universe does not exist? | wcp blog
C	a typical 'candidate event' in the higgs-hunting cms experiment. red lines represent high-energy proton beams while yellow lines show the tracks of particles produced in the collision. (quote) the higgs boson appears in a theory first fleshed out in 1964 by peter higgs at edinburgh university and five other physicists. finding the particle proves there is an energy field that fills the vacuum of the observable universe. it plays the crucial role of giving mass to certain subatomic particles that are the building blocks of matter. the higgs field is thought to have switched on a trillionth of a second after the big bang that blasted the universe into existence. without it, or something to do its job, the structure of the cosmos would be radically different than it is today. so what is the higgs boson? according to howstuffworks, it's a hypothetical particle predicted by the standard model of physics that is thought to give mass to matter -- so basically it's just how the universe was formed, no big deal. but researchers aren't quite ready to say they've made a discovery. "i agree that any reasonable outside observer would say, 'it looks like a discovery,'" theoretical physicist john ellis, a professor who works at the european organization for nuclear research (cern), tells the associated press. "we've discovered something which is consistent with being a higgs." 'god particle' that gives mass to the universe thought to have been found in large hadron collider, announce scientists in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist.

C	geneva (reuters) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. "nobel prizes all round." higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. end of an era "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose.

"i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant."

T	physicists find particle that could be the higgs boson - nytimes.com
C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times scientists at the fermilab in batavia, ill., on wednesday watched the presentation about the discovery of the higgs boson, which was shown from geneva. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

C	geneva - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the slatester higgs boson, aka the "god particle," is trending as physicists at the cern, which operates the large hadron collider in switzerland, announced they may have finally glimpsed the elusive elemental particle critical to our understanding of how the universe works. named after physicist peter higgs, the subatomic particle is seen as the lynchpin to explain what gives mass and gravity to all other particles, thus allowing matter to interact the way we observe it. the hunt for higgs boson has been going on for decades. scientists at the cern say the latest evidence is not a definitive discovery but that the data is "exciting" and suggests that with further statistical analysis, they should know within a year if the theoretical higgs boson actually exists. gigitv1 god particle why the truth about the higgs boson is still probably stranger than fiction thoughts 'the god particle': the higgs boson thoughts higgs boson: new data said to narrow hunt for 'god' particle thoughts scientists may have observed elusive higgs boson "god particle" thoughts physicists at cern, the european organisation for nuclear research, have announced new evidence hinting towards although not quite confirming - the existence of the so-called god particle, aka the higgs boson.current best guesses put the date of the higgs' final discovery at some time towards the end of 2012.the elusive particle is almost impossible to see with human instruments, but theoretically makes up much of the mass of the universe and helps explain missing elements in the general model of how stuff works. if that sounds simplistic, well, it is. when it comes to the higgs boson, it's hard to be anything but. higgs boson god particle cern particle physics physics lhc large hadron collider god particle found subatomic particles michio kaku on the 'god particle' thoughts the daily science news higgs boson god god particle easter physics theory physics quantum cern dark matter universe earth space scifi ipad app higgs boson god particle cern lhc large hadron collider discovery discoveries nasa space life universe big bang physics explanation secret origin creation human being alien extraterrestrial planet outer galaxy ufo earth aliens egypt ancient energy history world knowledge quantum slapmeifucan scientists hunting the elusive subatomic "higgs" particle will unveil findings on wednesday that take them nearer to understanding how the big bang at the dawn of time gave rise to stars, planets and even life. physicists who have been smashing particles together at near light-speed at the cern laboratory near geneva have already seen tantalizing glimpses of the "higgs boson", the missing piece of the fundamental theory of physics known as the standard model. the world of science now awaits a mass of evidence big enough to be deemed a formal discovery. the secrecy surrounding wednesday's announcement has fuelled speculation that nearly 40 years of research have reached a climax. cern accidentally released a video on its website briefly overnight announcing a "new particle" had been observed, but cern representatives declined to comment on whether that was what would be announced later in the day. "this video was released due to a technical glitch on our side here at cern. the final results have not yet been released," cern press officer renilde vanden broeck said in melbourne. she said the organization had prepared several videos for a range of outcomes for wednesday's announcement. a cern physicist who knows what will be announced said the discovery was not necessarily definitive.

"we have quite strong evidence that there's something there. its properties are still going to take us a little bit of time. "but we can see that it decays to two photons, for example, which tells us it's a boson, it's a particle with integer spin. and we know its mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the proton. and this is very significant. this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all of this, which i think we will," mr incandela, the cms spokesperson says. "and this is very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he adds. the origin of mass has been fiercely debated for decades. vanderkok go directly to the full story at www.dailymail.co.uk "...by rob cooper ...scientists at cern will announce that the elusive higgs boson 'god particle' has been found at a press conference next week, it is believed.five leading theoretical physicists have been invited to the event on wednesday - sparking speculation that the particle has been discovered.scientists at the large hadron collider are expected to say they are 99.99 per cent certain it has been found - which is known as 'four sigma' level..." read more: www.dailymail.co.uk also, "by john heilprin and seth borenstein...geneva -- scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher plan to announce wednesday that they have gathered enough evidence to show that the long-sought "god particle" answering fundamental questions about the universe almost certainly does exist...." read more here: www.sacbee.com -----brief position statement & invitation to christ by vander: if you see an obama ad on any of my videos, i want u to know i do not endorse obama, & have asked youtube not to post political ads on my channel, but they still do. i am a strong advocate of pro-life, traditional marriage, kindness to all, & other generally conservative viewpoints. for a more complete statement, & an invitation to accept jesus christ as your savior, as well as links to my audio-bibles, et al, go to: vanderkok.posterous.com hjalmarsnoep particle physics for dummies in 60 secs from the helium hamsters. transscription: breaking news from the science front.. this is helium-hamster-news with the facts in under a minute the 13th of december 2011 cern anounced they found evidence to the existence of the higgs-boson. het higgs-boson was probably found with a certainty of 97 % and it's a big, for a particle. on 4 juli 2012 this was officially confirmed. now what does that all mean? as you might know the higgs-boson was a theoreticall particle since the 1960's. it completed the standard model of particle physics. this is not a grand unifying theory because it conveniently leaves out gravity, which as we know, does exist. it does however not conflict with special relativity or quantum mechanics. so it's a big deal and a step forward, but we don't know everything yet. so what can does this mean for hamsterkind? the x higgs boson functions as a bridge to convert energy into matter. it also is needed in a theory of why the universe isn't made off equal parts antimatter and matter. this breaks a otherwise universal symmetry-law. everything has it's opposite. there is another break in this symmetry-law which is the direction of time. time can be slowed down or sped up, but never reversed. so can we use this higgs boson to travel in time...? evidence suggests that hamsters might be able to travel backwards in time by the year 2025. remember folks, you heard it here first, at helium hamster news. for more info about the ibtimesuk cern, the european organization for nuclear research made a ground-breaking announcement that scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) have discovered a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the long-sought higgs boson. known as the elusive "god particle", as it gives mass to all other particles in the universe. the search for the higgs boson has been going on for decades at a cost of billions of pounds. scientists have now announced they have seen the best evidence yet that it exists. here professor john ellis, explained what it is. "what it is? it's the last piece in the 'standard model.' the standard model describes all the matter that we can see in the universe, you, me, the planet, the stars, galaxies, all that matter is described by the standard model. that description only makes sense if a higgs boson exists or something very similar to it." here is the large hadron collider in the cern underground lab which was used to hunt the higgs boson since 1984. professor ellis then explains just what a ground-breaking discovery this is. "so it's very exciting that finally, after so many years of looking and waiting and searching, we may finally discover the missing link that really makes our description of the matter in the universe sensible. maybe it's the higgs boson, maybe it's not higgs boson, but finally, i think, we gonna start seeing the boson." written and presented by ann salter villeyfocustv to cheers and standing ovations from scientists, the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson popularly known as the "god particle" that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape."we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists.he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself an extremely fine distinction."as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of higgs boson, the 'god particle' - columbia missourian
C	print eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of higgs boson, the 'god particle' wednesday, july 4, 2012 | 6:47 p.m. cdt geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 17-mile underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." what's this?) report corrections or additions here. leave comments logged in to participate in the show me the errors contest. leave a comment speak up and join the conversation! make sure to follow the guidelines outlined below and full comment policy is here .) don't use obscene, profane or vulgar language. don't use language that makes personal attacks on fellow commenters or discriminates based on race, religion, gender or ethnicity. use your real first and last name when registering on the website. it will be published with every comment.

T	it's a boson: higgs quest bears new particle | reuters
C	paradise regained: clayton christensen and the path to salvation geneva (reuters) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the "celebrity" of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. "that is what we are sure is the higgs," a cern scientist said. "it's a boson!" headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the "dramatic 5 sigma signal" for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. "the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful," oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. "we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted." "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: "cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson," he said. "in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs." the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: "we have closed one chapter and opened another," said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: "this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made." higgs himself called it a great achievement for cern's collider. without it, his ideas would remain just a paper theory and he conceded that he personally was never cut out for laboratory experimentation: "i certainly did some lab work as a schoolboy in bristol," he told reuters. "i was incompetent." we welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data. if you see a comment that you believe is irrelevant or inappropriate, you can flag it to our editors by using the report abuse links. views expressed in the comments do not represent those of reuters. for more information on our comment policy, see but, we won't be able to answer-as of yet- what gave rise to the big bang itself!

C	share and discuss tweet evidence of 'god particle' found: cern see photo geneva: to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle on wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the " god particle " - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. ``as a layman, i think we did it,'' he told the elated crowd. ``we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson.'' the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said on wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "what do we have?" the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the ``standard model'' higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question on wednesday. ``it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model,'' heuer said. ``we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson.'' higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. ``it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime,'' he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-km underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it ``a higgs-like particle'' and said ``we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found.'' ``thanks, nature!'' gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that ``the standard model (of physics) is not complete'' but that ``the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that.'' the phrase ``god particle'' was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. ``this boson is a very profound thing we have found,'' he said. ``we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story ... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration.''

T	physicists find particle that could be the higgs boson - nytimes.com
C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times scientists at the fermilab in batavia, ill., on wednesday watched the presentation about the discovery of the higgs boson, which was shown from geneva. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

C	higgs boson in a nutshell: cosmic molasses is real hat tip to dennis overbye at the times for boiling down why it matters that the higgs boson has been seen in the data of the large hadron collider experiments ( cern physicists may have discovered higgs boson particle - nytimes.com ): according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. invisible to us, that is, and to the limited range of machines we make to measure what we can -- we who have been slowed down enough by cosmic molasses to become physical rather than keep moving at the speed of light. ap a wall painting by artist josef kristofoletti at the atlas experiment site at the european center for nuclear research, cern, outside geneva, switzerland, shows what a higgs boson may look like. he continues, ...any deviations from the simplest version of the boson -- and there are hints of some already -- could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? perhaps, in an alternative antimatter universe, scientists are asking the inverse of the same question. news tip: (401) 277-7303 | classifieds: (401) 277-7700 | display advertising: (401) 277-8000 | subscriptions: (401) 277-7600

T	higgs boson | particle 'consistent' with higgs boson... | stuff.co.nz
C	higgs boson particle may have been found scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected.

T	nz scientists welcome higgs news - yahoo! new zealand news
C	new zealand scientists are welcoming the news that the so-called "god particle" - the higgs boson - appears to have been discovered. scientists at cern in geneva confirmed on wednesday night (nzt) they had discovered a particle fitting the description of the higgs boson in experiments at the large hadron collider (lhc). the theoretical particle is key to the scientific understanding of all matter. physicists stressed the results presented at a joint conference in melbourne and geneva were preliminary. they were unsure if the particle was the long sought-after higgs boson or something more "exotic". "the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe," a cern statement said. cern director general rolf heuer said it was a milestone in humankind's "understanding of nature". "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." the head of auckland university's physics department, professor richard easther, said the news marks a huge step forward for particle physics. "we are definitely seeing a new class of particle for the first time in 30 years, and this new particle looks like the long-sought higgs boson," he said. "if this identification holds up we will understand why subatomic particles have mass, a breakthrough that would rank with (sir ernest) rutherford's discovery of the atomic nucleus." another auckland university physicist, dr david krofcheck, is a member of cms, one of two cern collaborations hunting the higg's boson. yahoo! new zealand news preferences

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle | world news | the guardian
C	john heilprin associated press= geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of physics. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists shed tears reflecting on the decades of work that brought them to this momentous occasion. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd.

T	higgs boson 'discovered', existence of mass in universe explained by 'god particle' - forbes
C	cern in switzerland have confirmed the existence of the elusive higgs boson-or something very much like it. "the cms experiments at cern today presented their latest results in the search for the long-sought higgs boson . both experiments see strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (gev)," cern has announced on their website . "the experiments found hints of the new particle by analysing trillions of proton-proton collisions from the standard model of particle physics predicts that a higgs boson would decay into different particles - which the lhc experiments then detect." atlas and cms have characterized "the level of significance of the result as 5 sigma on the scale that particle physicists use to describe the certainty of a discovery. one sigma means the results could be random fluctuations in the data, 3 sigma counts as an observation and a 5-sigma result is a discovery." business practitioners of 6 sigma methodology will see that this is (really) close to certainty, but no cigar quite yet. for half a century, physicists have had this problem. the standard model , developed in the 1960s, so elegantly describes so many aspects of the physical universe-but it leaves out 96% of the mass. big problem. so it has been job #1 to find the missing mass-to describe a mechanism by which particles acquire mass. at higher and higher levels of energy, the different forces of the universe-gravity, electromagnetism, the weak and strong forces-unify like in the first instants after the big bang, and it is possible to "see" phenomena that are too volatile to observe in everyday life. the standard model predicts that one of those volatile things is the higgs boson, a particle (or class of particles) that are "gobbled up" by other particles, giving them mass. [note: massive oversimplification! ] the pursuit of the missing mass, and the elusive bosons, has been accomplished with the use of higher and higher-powered particle accelerators, all the way up to the present lhc at cern. in its first year of operation, it would seem that the lhc has succeeded at manifesting a particle that has the characteristics of the higgs. years of study are ahead for scientists at cern to confirm exactly what they have seen. is it the "simple" higgs predicted by the model, or something more exotic that points to other avenues of research? for the moment, its discovery does firm up what we know about mass in physics, which is a big deal. in the video (above) just released by cern, theoretical physicist john ellis explains the concept of the higgs field, "empty space is like a medium, and as particles travel through this medium, some of them interact with it, some of them don't interact with it. the ones that do interact with this medium, they acquire masses. the ones that pass through without interacting, those are our massless particles." ellis compares this to an endless field of snow, with different particles either gliding on the top (like fast, "massless" skiers) or sinking down into it (like a person walking in deep powder). philip tanedo provides technical but lucid explanations of all of this (complete with user-friendly diagrams) at his wonderful why we expect a higgs boson." why does this matter? because this hierarchical asymmetry of particles that is explained by the existence of the higgs field is something we do, indeed, experience in everyday life. look at the power law distribution of wealth, ideas or popularity in society and you will see the same mechanisms at play. some entities-from people to products, companies to concepts-acquire mass, influence and prestige while other go unnoticed. these "massive particles" emit lot of light (i.e.: buzz). social media, twitter in particular, has been really useful in making this process concrete, and companies like klout and others have tried to turn this "big data" into usable data-with mixed results. on a more philosophical level-and the reason why the higgs has been known as the "god particle"-it makes a difference to our state of mind believing that most of the mass in the universe is explained as opposed to 96% random. there are still the mysteries of dark matter, dark energy and antimatter to sort out, but a higgs universe is less of a godless anarchy than one without it. a proton-proton collision event in the cms experiment producing two high-energy photons (red towers). this is what we would expect to see from the decay of a higgs boson but it is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. ? cern 2012 i am a content strategist, designer and developer. i use my experience as a magazine art director and web editor to help publishers, marketers, non-profits and self-branded individuals tell their stories in words and images. i follow all of the technologies that relate to the content business and try to identify the opportunities and pitfalls that these technologies pose. at the same time i am immersed in certain sectors through my content practice and am always looking to find connections between the worlds of neurology, economics, entertainment, travel and mobile technology. i live near the appropriately-scaled metropolis of portland, maine, and occasionally write about the creative economy in portland in wingandko.com . the author is a forbes contributor. the opinions expressed are those of the writer. amazon cloud goes down friday night, taking netflix, instagram and pinterest with it will october's iphone 5 look like this? is this how apple dreams become our realities? android payback: apple to cut google out of stunning new 3d maps app in ios6

C	covering your world eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle 0.0 (0 votes) geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of physics. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists shed tears reflecting on the decades of work that brought them to this momentous occasion. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, sends protons whizzing in a circle at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks.

"we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the centre's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, sends protons whizzing in a circle at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, head of the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometre (17-mile) underground tunnel. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be found, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the theory got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development the way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible.

T	quantum spirit: possible ending to a long scientific search
C	a section of cern's large hadron collider. leading physicists are saying it's still too soon to know whether cern's newly discovered subatomic particle fits the description given by the standard model ~ the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century ~ or whether it is an impostor, a single particle, or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. according to today's new york times, cern director rolf-dieter heuer's exclamation earlier today of, "i think we have it," signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the times contends, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. click here for the complete article .

C	peter higgs looking happy as f@#k. if you want to see a room full of white-haired elderly men weep, take a trip to cern. the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) is super stoked over the discovery of a sub-atomic particle that may be the sneaky higgs boson. physicists have been breaking an almost-half-a-century sweat to find this trickster. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," said cern physicist yves sirois . shit. that is exciting. standing oh's and cheers erupted after scientists presented new data for the elusive particle that many believe to confer mass. they're 99.99% sure that this particle is the one. the gist of the particle is that it plays a key role in explaining how the higgs mechanism happens in nature. this mechanism gives mass to elementary particles. in other words, it's a jackpot day for physicists everywhere. the 4th of july may not only mark american independence, but also the potential discovery of higgs boson. throwing up a fist for the god particle. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer . what did the sweet mannered peter higgs have to say about this discovery? "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," said the 83-year-old british physicist. higgs first published the conceptual groundwork for the boson in 1964, and this discover has caused tears of joy from veteran scientists. "it may be the higgs boson," adds yves sirois, "but it may also be something far bigger, which opens the door towards a new theory that goes beyond the standard model." well done, sir, well done.

T	jul 4 - discovery of a new particle higgs boson
C	jul 4 - discovery of a new particle higgs boson jul 4 - discovery of a new particle higgs boson - photo posted in bx daily bugle - news and headlines | sign in and leave a comment below!" style="max-width:675px; max-height:675px; width:expression(this.width> 675?675:true); height:expression(this.height>675?675:true);" /> geneva (reuters) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists[..]embled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. "nobel prizes all round." higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. end of an era "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon,[..]ociated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the "celebrity" of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. "that is what we are sure is the higgs," a cern scientist said. less than one in a million "it's a boson!" headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the "dramatic 5 sigma signal" for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. "the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful," oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. "we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted." "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: "cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson," he said. "in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: "we have closed one chapter and opened another," said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: "this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made." higgs himself called it a great achievement for cern's collider. without it, his ideas would remain just a paper theory and he conceded that he personally was never cut out for laboratory experimentation: "i certainly did some lab work as a schoolboy in bristol," he told reuters.

(ap photo/cern) scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the higgs boson anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research , have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super- symmetry " where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern . scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. copyright 2012 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. 0 share to facebook physorg.com on fb tweet physorg.com on twitter reddit delicious yahoo! bookmarks rss qr code view popular send feedback to editors not rated yet 1 2 3 4 5

C	geneva (pti): the five-decade-long hunt for the elusive higgs boson or the "god particle" has reached a milestone, with scientists at the cern claiming today that they have discovered a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to be crucial for formation of the universe. joe incandela, leader of one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom smasher, told a packed audience of scientists at the european center for nuclear research (cern) that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. meanwhile, the second team of physicists also claimed they have observed a new particle, probably the elusive higgs boson. the announcements were made to huge applause by scientists including peter higgs who first suggested the existence of the particle in 1964. in a statement, cern said the particle they found at lhc is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," but more data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces.

T	higgs, 83, sheds tears as discovery of higgs boson is announced
C	geneva - retired british physicist peter higgs, who first proposed the higgs boson in 1964, and after whom the particle was named, has congratulated the cern team that found the new particle described as "consistent" with the higgs boson. it was higgs who first proposed in 1964, that particles acquire mass by interacting with a field that pervades the entire universe.the field he proposed with five other colleagues, which came to be known as the higgs field , in association with the particle that transmits its effect, explains why some particles are more massive than others. digital journal reports that scientists describe the higgs field as an energy field that spreads out in the whole universe. particles moving in the higgs field experience it as a kind of sticky molasses that slows them down and keeps them from moving at the speed of light. without the slowing down effect of the higgs field, particles would travel through space at the speed of light and would, therefore, be unable to bind together to form atoms that make up material objects in the universe. the formal announcement that the higgs boson has been identified at the benchmark 5-sigma level of statistical certainty, equivalent to 99.99994% level of certainty, came on wednesday at a seminar at the geneva headquarters of daily mail, it is latest piece of the jigsaw puzzle that indicates that scientists' view of the universe is substantially right. cern overview of the first elements of the huge magnet of the cms experimental site. cern scientists announced their first glimpse of the higgs boson in december and since then they have been patiently sifting through the mass of statistical data for definitive evidence. although the scientists insist that the work done so far to identify the new particle is preliminary, there are generally confident that its properties are consistent with the proposed boson. herald sun, confirming the existence of the higgs boson, popularly called the "god particle," is vital to the but on wednesday, scientists working with the large hadron collider in cern, said that two of the lhc's detectors, the atlas and the cms, have returned results that actually reached the 5-sigma level, the gold standard of evidence in particle physics. herald sun, the sigma measures how likely it is that a statistical pattern is chance. at a 5-sigma level, the chance that the statistical pattern is fluke is one in a million. press release , the atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, said: "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication." according to cms experiment spokesman joe incandela ,"this is indeed a new particle. this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years." the alpha antimatter trap experiment at cern, headquartered in geneva, switzerland press release: "the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe. are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient in the standard model of particle physics? or is it something more exotic? the standard model describes the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them. all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about 4% of the total. a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96% of the universe that remains obscure." the alpha antimatter trap experiment at cern, headquartered in geneva, switzerland professor peter higgs, who first proposed existence of the boson, attended the geneva seminar. reports say higgs appeared to wipe away a tear when the findings were announced. herald sun reports he later said: "i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement. it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime." : "i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them." the telegraph reports that higgs' colleagues are now calling for him to be honored with knighthood or a nobel prize in recognition of his contribution to the physics. the telegraph, professor jim al-khalili, professor of physics at the university of surrey, said: "of all the people worthy of a knighthood i cannot think of anyone more deserving right now than peter higgs. his incredible prediction almost half a century ago of the existence of a new particle that bears his name has turned out to be correct and will surely now revolutionise physics. " gerry guralnik, one of the six physicists who proposed the idea of the higgs boson in 1954, said: "he should be [knighted]. he has made a great contribution to what looks like a great discovery." uk met office warns of month's worth of rain to fall in 36 hours

T	a new particle could be physics' holy grail | ndtv.com
C	a view of the lhc (large hadron collider) in its tunnel at cern. (ap photo) aspen (colorado): physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signalled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "i was really impressed. it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins!" at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads - will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart. "i believe it now; i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy - einstein showed they are the same - that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr incandela's and dr gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr gianotti said at one point: "why are you applauding? i'm not done yet. this is just beginning. there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviours and channels. "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons; and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr higgs of the university of edinburgh was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london, carl hagen of university of rochester, dr guralnik of brown university, and francois englert and the late robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odourless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of large hadron collider. both dr heuer and dr gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of the year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing some its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgs-like fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an anti-gravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe, and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said dr tonelli. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillions of proton collisions, will tell. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team at cern wrote about the higgs, "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time."

T	higgs boson 'discovered', existence of mass in universe explained by 'god particle' - forbes
C	cern in switzerland have confirmed the existence of the elusive higgs boson-or something very much like it. "the cms experiments at cern today presented their latest results in the search for the long-sought higgs boson . both experiments see strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (gev)," cern has announced on their website . "the experiments found hints of the new particle by analysing trillions of proton-proton collisions from the standard model of particle physics predicts that a higgs boson would decay into different particles - which the lhc experiments then detect." atlas and cms have characterized "the level of significance of the result as 5 sigma on the scale that particle physicists use to describe the certainty of a discovery. one sigma means the results could be random fluctuations in the data, 3 sigma counts as an observation and a 5-sigma result is a discovery." business practitioners of 6 sigma methodology will see that this is (really) close to certainty, but no cigar quite yet. for half a century, physicists have had this problem. the standard model , developed in the 1960s, so elegantly describes so many aspects of the physical universe-but it leaves out 96% of the mass. big problem. so it has been job #1 to find the missing mass-to describe a mechanism by which particles acquire mass. at higher and higher levels of energy, the different forces of the universe-gravity, electromagnetism, the weak and strong forces-unify like in the first instants after the big bang, and it is possible to "see" phenomena that are too volatile to observe in everyday life. the standard model predicts that one of those volatile things is the higgs boson, a particle (or class of particles) that are "gobbled up" by other particles, giving them mass. [note: massive oversimplification! ] the pursuit of the missing mass, and the elusive bosons, has been accomplished with the use of higher and higher-powered particle accelerators, all the way up to the present lhc at cern. in its first year of operation, it would seem that the lhc has succeeded at manifesting a particle that has the characteristics of the higgs. years of study are ahead for scientists at cern to confirm exactly what they have seen. is it the "simple" higgs predicted by the model, or something more exotic that points to other avenues of research? for the moment, its discovery does firm up what we know about mass in physics, which is a big deal. in the video (above) just released by cern, theoretical physicist john ellis explains the concept of the higgs field, "empty space is like a medium, and as particles travel through this medium, some of them interact with it, some of them don't interact with it. the ones that do interact with this medium, they acquire masses. the ones that pass through without interacting, those are our massless particles." ellis compares this to an endless field of snow, with different particles either gliding on the top (like fast, "massless" skiers) or sinking down into it (like a person walking in deep powder). philip tanedo provides technical but lucid explanations of all of this (complete with user-friendly diagrams) at his wonderful why we expect a higgs boson." why does this matter? because this hierarchical asymmetry of particles that is explained by the existence of the higgs field is something we do, indeed, experience in everyday life. look at the power law distribution of wealth, ideas or popularity in society and you will see the same mechanisms at play. some entities-from people to products, companies to concepts-acquire mass, influence and prestige while other go unnoticed. these "massive particles" emit lot of light (i.e.: buzz) social media, twitter in particular, has been really useful in making this process concrete, and companies like klout and others have tried to turn this "big data" into usable data-with mixed results. on a more philosophical level-and the reason why the higgs has been known as the "god particle"-it makes a difference to our state of mind believing that most of the mass in the universe is explained as opposed to 96% random. there are still the mysteries of dark matter, dark energy and antimatter to sort out, but a higgs universe is less of a godless anarchy than one without it. a proton-proton collision event in the cms experiment producing two high-energy photons (red towers). this is what we would expect to see from the decay of a higgs boson but it is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. ? cern 2012 i am a content strategist, designer and developer. i use my experience as a magazine art director and web editor to help publishers, marketers, non-profits and self-branded individuals tell their stories in words and images. i follow all of the technologies that relate to the content business and try to identify the opportunities and pitfalls that these technologies pose. at the same time i am immersed in certain sectors through my content practice and am always looking to find connections between the worlds of neurology, economics, entertainment, travel and mobile technology. i live near the appropriately-scaled metropolis of portland, maine, and occasionally write about the creative economy in portland in wingandko.com . the author is a forbes contributor. the opinions expressed are those of the writer. amazon cloud goes down friday night, taking netflix, instagram and pinterest with it will october's iphone 5 look like this? is this how apple dreams become our realities? android payback: apple to cut google out of stunning new 3d maps app in ios6

T	higgins boson, or 'god particle,' hailed as 'the missing cornerstone of physics' | nola.com
C	scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of physics. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. view full size martial trezzini, keystone, via the associated press british physicist peter higgs, left, arrives to hear about the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in near geneva, switzerland, on wednesday. as the highly technical findings were announced in geneva by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists shed tears reflecting on the decades of work that brought them to this momentous occasion . the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, sends protons whizzing in a circle at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, head of the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 17-mile underground tunnel. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be found, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the theory got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development the way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." john heilprin of the associated press wrote this report.

T	fisica: rv: physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson
C	fuente: caltech news releases expuesto el: mi?rcoles, 04 de julio de 2012 6:00 autor: caltech news releases asunto: physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson the compact muon solenoid (cms) detector at the large hadron collider (lhc). [credit: cern] pasadena, calif.-physicists at the large hadron collider (lhc) in geneva, switzerland, have discovered a new particle that may be the long-sought higgs boson, the fundamental particle that is thought to endow elementary particles with mass. "this is a momentous time in the history of particle physics and in scientific exploration-the implications are profound," says harvey newman, professor of physics at the california institute of technology (caltech). "this is experimental science at its best." the international team of scientists and engineers-which includes a large contingent from caltech, led by newman and maria spiropulu, professor of physics-says it needs more data to determine for certain if the particle they've discovered is indeed the higgs boson predicted by the standard model, the theory that describes how all particles interact. the results so far, however, show that it has many of the properties expected for such a particle. "one of the most exciting aspects of this observation is that the road remains open for a vast range of 'lookalike' alternatives, where any deviation from the standard model would point the way to the existence of other new particles or forces of nature," newman says. regardless of the exact identity of the new particle, cern's scientists say, the highly anticipated discovery heralds a new era in physics. the physicists revealed their latest results at a seminar at the european center for nuclear research (cern) in geneva, which was shared with the world with a live webcast and the evo (enabling virtual organizations) system developed at caltech. the discovery itself is based on the analysis of an unprecedented amount of data that was collected by the two main detectors at the lhc-the compact muon solenoid (cms) and a toroidal lhc apparatus (atlas). the data was collected with the lhc running at 7 teraelectron volts (tev, a unit of energy) in 2011 and 8 tev in 2012. the caltech team is part of the cms collaboration. using the cms detector, the physicists identified signals that point to a new particle with a mass of 125 gigaelectron volts (gev, a unit of mass; in comparison, the mass of a proton is about 1 gev). the team running the atlas detector, which searches for the higgs using a different method, reported similar results. "this is an incredible, exciting moment," says spiropulu. "even these early results give us important hints as to how mass in the universe came to be. together with hundreds of our colleagues caltech scientists have worked for decades to reach this point: building multiple generations of experiments; designing and building detectors to precisely measure photons, electrons, and muons, which are keys to the discovery; and inventing worldwide systems that empower thousands of physicists throughout the world to collaborate day and night, share and analyze the data, and develop the new techniques leading to this great result." to search for the higgs, physicists have had to comb through the remains of trillions of particle collisions produced by the lhc, which accelerates protons around a ring almost five miles wide to nearly the speed of light. as the protons careen toward each other, a small fraction of them collide, creating other particles such as the higgs. it is estimated that it takes one billion collisions to make just one higgs boson. the higgs is fleeting, however, and quickly decays into lighter particles, which are the traces that allow the higgs to be detected and analyzed. the higgs is predicted to decay in several different ways, or channels, each resulting in different particles. cms focuses mainly on the decay channels that result in two photons or two other particles called z bosons. it was by measuring and analyzing these and other decay particles that the physicists were able to discover the potential higgs. when all the decays are taken into account in combination, the scientists announced, the data for a signal corresponding to a standard model higgs boson have a statistical significance of five sigmas. this means the signal is highly unlikely to be the result of a statistical fluke caused by some rare, background fluctuation. only when data are significant to five sigmas are physicists confident enough to declare a discovery. last december, evidence seen in the data from cms generated plenty of excitement as a result of an excess of events-a slight surplus in particle collision events over what would have been expected if the higgs does not exist-with a statistical significance of just three sigmas. the higgs boson is the last remaining fundamental particle predicted by the standard model yet to be detected, and hopes of detecting it was one of the chief reasons for building the lhc. the lhc accelerator, along with the cms and atlas experiments, are arguably the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. despite its many successes, the standard model is incomplete-it does not incorporate gravity or dark matter, for example. one of the goals of physicists, then, is to develop more complete theories that better explain the composition of the universe and what happened during the first moments after the big bang. discovering the higgs boson-or a particle like it-is essential for developing these new theories. the measurements of the new particle, the physicists say, are so far consistent-within statistical uncertainty-with the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. still, they need more data to know for sure whether it is the predicted higgs or something stranger, a higgs lookalike-a prospect that many theorists have long been anticipating. by the end of 2012, the caltech researchers say, the cms collaboration expects to more than double its current total amount of data. with more data and analysis, the scientists might then be able to confirm whether the particle they announced tonight is indeed the higgs-and whether it is the standard model higgs or a more exotic version. written by marcus woo ver art?culo...

T	business of life: congratulations to cern
C	how wonderful it is to see scientists break through to truth by uncovering, discovering, what is already there and which, up to this time, was only a theory. the higgs boson is the new subatomic particle confirmed by great work by a great many over 40 years. hearty congratulations. scientists discover new subatomic particle at the center of everything a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson - or the "god particle," to the chagrin of scientists - the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. -- we have a discovery," heuer said. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." applause broke out. the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. moments later, higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." --- "we know the higgs is at the center of everything, " said lykken. "this is why [nobel prize-winning physicist] leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more massive objects get tangled up in the field - and hence, slowed down as they move - more than less massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of criss-crossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. the idea of the higgs, or something like it, has been around since 1964, when it was first hypothesized by peter higgs. the standard model of physics had a hole in it - one that needed to be filled by a particle that imbues everything with mass. it became known as the higgs boson - and its discovery, many scientists say, will now surely garner a nobel prize. mass is not the same thing as weight, although the two concepts are easily confused. an object has mass even in outer space. mass is an object's resistance to being shoved around - its inertia. a photon, which is a light particle, has no mass because it zips through the higgs ocean without interacting with it . light speed is the cosmic speed limit for this reason - because nothing can have less-than-zero interaction with the higgs field. ( mass can then be described as the quality that keeps everything from moving at the speed of light.) physicists will now turn their attention to understanding the new particle. crucially, they will want to know whether it behaves like a mass-giving higgs, and more specifically whether it behaves like the higgs predicted in the standard model. --- "fine, there is something there - a resonance," says martinus veltman, emeritus professor at the university of michigan in ann arbor, who shared the 1999 nobel prize in physics for his work on the standard model. " now we have to find out if it has all the properties that the higgs is supposed to have." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. professor higgs wipes a tear from his eye as fellow scientists find his 'god particle' on 'momentous day for science' - 40 years after he predicted its existence the hunt for the higgs boson - the 'god particle' that holds the universe together - is over. scientists at switzerland's cern (the european council for nuclear research) announced the discovery to an audience including professor peter higgs, who first suggested the existence of the particle in 1964 after he dreamed up the idea while walking in the highlands. professor higgs, 83, wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were announced, and later said: 'it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.' an audience of the world's leading physicists rose in a standing ovation to celebrate the find - the culmination of a decades-long search at the large hadron collider and other particle accelerators such as america's tevatron. the discovery is the biggest leap in physics for decades - filling in a crucial gap in our understanding of the atom. in the long term, the discovery could lead to new technologies. -- the discovery fills in the last gap in the 'standard model' of physics - proving einstein right, and possibly leading to new technologies built on our understanding of the workings of the atom. in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalizing glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' is the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. 'we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, ' said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, 'but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.' 'the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found ,' said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. -- physicists needed the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. professor paul dauncey, professor of particle physics at imperial college london said: 'this is a major breakthrough for our understanding of the universe?..'but

T	scientists find subatomic particle at the center of everything -- nation -- bangor daily news -- bdn maine
C	scientists find subatomic particle at the center of everything a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson - or the "god particle," to the chagrin of scientists - the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," said heuer. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," said heuer. moments later, higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution - a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" - scientists around the world celebrated the moment. a video feed from melbourne, australia, where an international physics conference is set to begin, showed an auditorium packed with cheering scientists. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at fermilab, longtime home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, some 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," said lincoln. "people were riveted. discovery is what scientists live for." at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared a bottle of champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts, one of the more than 6,000 scientists who contributed to the discovery. "i'm still astonished that at 3 a.m. on the fourth of july you can gather" so many people excited about the arcane field of subatomic physics, tuts said. high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and professors all shared the bubbly after the discovery became clear. "we toasted this," said tuts. "it was great fun to see the culmination of years and years of work." with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 - set two years ago to line up with the conference in melbourne - cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the huge large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation wednesday morning. the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found - and the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field the permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," said lykken. "this is why [nobel prize-winning physicist] leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more massive objects get tangled up in the field - and hence, slowed down as they move - more than less massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of criss-crossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. two independent teams, working on two separate particle detectors, arrived at similar results - a kind of cross-check. the two teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not to share their results with each other before the seminar at cern wednesday. to find this tiny particle, scientists built the biggest of machines - a 17-mile ring under the french-swiss border called the large hadron collider (lhc). at two points along the ring, they installed cathedral-sized detectors that capture traces of high-energy collisions of protons. inside this subatomic wreckage, both detectors saw evidence for a subatomic particle with a mass of around 125 giga-electron volts - or about 125 times the mass of a proton. cern announced last december that it was homing in on the higgs, but cautioned that it needed a new batch of high-energy collisions to gain confidence that scientists were seeing something real and not a random bump in the data. the hunt for the higgs represented a test for theorists and, at a more nuts-and-bolts level, for the public officials who decided to green-light the extraordinarily elaborate and tricky endeavor to find a hypothetical particle. an explosion in one of the lhc's sensitive superconducting magnets in september 2008 delayed operations for more than year. but this biggest of big science experiments now appears to have paid off. the idea of the higgs, or something like it, has been around since 1964, when it was first hypothesized by peter higgs. the standard model of physics had a hole in it - one that needed to be filled by a particle that imbues everything with mass. it became known as the higgs boson - and its discovery, many scientists say, will now surely garner a nobel prize. mass is not the same thing as weight, although the two concepts are easily confused. an object has mass even in outer space. mass is an object's resistance to being shoved around - its inertia. a photon, which is a light particle, has no mass because it zips through the higgs ocean without interacting with it. light speed is the cosmic speed limit for this reason - because nothing can have less-than-zero interaction with the higgs field. (mass can then be described as the quality that keeps everything from moving at the speed of light.) a neutrino has an extremely small mass - it moves at nearly the speed of light (and not faster, as some european scientists suggested last year erroneously before finding a loose cable was the culprit for their weird results). ordinary matter that comprises the bulk of stars, planets and human beings is relatively massive. the most massive particles move like someone trying to walk through neck-high water. this notion of a field that gives particles mass has been essential to understanding the way the universe is put together. columbia university physicist brian greene, speaking prior to the announcement, said, "everything i've ever done, directly or indirectly, has something to do with a higgs-like field." the discovery of the higgs is the latest reminder that the universe can be understood through mathematics. guidelines for posting on bangordailynews.com the bangor daily news encourages comments about stories, but you must follow our terms of service . in brief: keep it civil and stay on topic no vulgarity, racial slurs, name-calling or personal attacks. people who harass others or joke about tragedies will be blocked. the primary rule here is pretty simple: treat others with the same respect you'd want for yourself. here are some guidelines ( don't insult one another or the subjects of bdn stories. you may be ticked off at what someone did or said, but you can explain that without resorting to name-calling or obscenity. remember that young people are on this site too. that nasty line that makes your buddies go "haw, haw"? you're better than that. comments should be your own work, not copied and pasted from elsewhere, though brief quoted passages to make your point are fine. and please don't use all capital letters. there's no need to shout. stay focused on the issue in the article. off-topic posts will be deleted. this isn't a forum to chat about your personal life. some ideas - the fate of the earth, abortion, gun control, the nature of god - aren't going to be resolved in a reader forum, so no need to get frustrated if others don't see your point of view. state your position once and leave it at that. if you mouse over each comment you will see a "flag" button. please use it if you feel comments on the site are out of line. quite often, we won't see a comment until it's reported. questions about why a comment was - or wasn't - deleted? e-mail us at web@bangordailynews.com and let us know your username and where you posted or saw the comment. ontario teen amazed that her 12-year-old message in a bottle surfaces in maine bdn at large: graffiti mural, portland bar run afoul of governor boston's crawford solid for sea dogs; ellsbury joins portland club wednesday walter hunt memorial 3k road race in brewer, bangor is wide open

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle - sfgate
C	geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research , or cern , erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer , director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton 's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara , leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti , the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking , said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher , a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman , but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web . cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries."

C	geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson , or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton 's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries."

T	cern physicists may have discovered higgs boson particle - nytimes.com
C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times proton collisions from the search. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data presented in graphs with bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti noted that the mass of the putative higgs, apparently one of the heaviest subatomic particles, made it easy to study its many behaviors. "thanks, nature," she said. gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause, like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime," he said. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented what came to be known as the higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and fran?ois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough with the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen possible ways, depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not describe how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find, eluding researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare in abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the "goddamn particle.") finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly. so far, the physicists admit, they know little about their new boson. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the boson while others might be underproducing it, clues that maybe there is more at work here than the standard model would predict. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said guido tonelli of cern. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team of physicists, said: "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins." a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

"thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. 5th annual bug festival at zilker park

C	john heilprin associated press= geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction.

"it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. syria crisis: turkey finds bodies of downed pilots - wednesday 4 july 2012 india's 'child picasso' puts on his goggles and takes aim at the canvas in the moment by tom jenkins ?20.00

T	physicists at cern?s large hadron collider discover new subatomic particle that looks like the higgs boson
C	higgs boson video: a metaphor to explain the particle, or further confuse you u.s. adds forces in persian gulf, a signal to iran (new york times, july 3, 2012) aspen, colo. - physicists working at large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "i was really impressed. it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins!" at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it affirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, like ourselves, is a result of flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a whole new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. dr. incandela said, "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." michael turner, a cosmologist at the university of chicago and the chairman of the physics center board, said, "this is a big moment for particle physics and a crossroads - will this be the high water mark or will it be the first of many discoveries that point us toward solving the really big questions that we have posed?" wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been holding their breath and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. they were racing to get ready for a major conference in melbourne that started on wednesday, where they had promised an update on the higgs search. in the end, the cern council, which consists of representatives from each of cern's 20 member states, decided that the potentially historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle also acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. on the eve of the announcement, in what was an embarrassing moment for the lab where the web was invented, a video of dr. incandela making his statement was posted to the internet and then quickly withdrawn. dr. incandela said he had made a series of video presentations with alternate conclusions so that the video producers would not know the right answer ahead of time, but the one that was right just happened to get posted. but the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant blur of heated air into a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal had grown over the last year, until it practically jumped off the chart. "i believe it now; i didn't before," said a physicist who was one of the first to see the new results but was not authorized to discuss them. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, in the units of mass and energy - einstein showed they are the same - that are favored by physicists, about as much as a whole barium atom, according to the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, so-called "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti said at one point: "why are you applauding? i'm not done yet. this is just beginning. there is more to come." she noted that the mass of the putative higgs made it easy to study its many behaviors and channels. "so," she said, "thanks, nature." gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed, saying, "for me, its really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime." in quantum theory, which is the language of particle physicists, elementary particles are divided into two rough categories: fermions, which are bits of matter like electrons, and bosons, which are bits of energy and can transmit forces, like the photon that transmits light. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented the notion of the cosmic molasses, or higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and francois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible and, of course, odorless, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough, by the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen different ways depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not say how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find. the pesky particle eluded researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare for abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, later quipping that he had wanted to call it "the goddamn particle." finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly, a tribute, they said, to the people who had built the collider and the detectors and learned to run them efficiently. "it's truly amazing," said lisa randall, a prominent harvard theorist. dr. heuer recently extended the current run of the collider an extra three months, to the end of this year, during which the experimenters say they expect to triple their data on the new particle, narrowing its possible identities. the collider will then shut down for two years for major repairs. when it starts up again, theories of both inner space and outer space could be up for grabs. although they have never been seen, higgslike fields play an important role in theories of the universe and in string theory. under certain conditions, according to the strange accounting of einsteinian physics, they can become suffused with energy that exerts an antigravitational force. such fields have been proposed as the source of an enormous burst of expansion, known as inflation, early in the universe and, possibly, as the secret of the dark energy that now seems to be speeding up the expansion of the universe. knowing more about the new particle will help put those theories on firmer ground, dr. turner of chicago said. so far, the physicists admit, they know little. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the higgs while others might be underproducing, clues maybe that there is more than the standard model at work. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," dr. tonelli said. cern will be examining the rest of the channels over the coming months and years, and the idea that the standard model could be cracking is a prospect that physicists find thrilling. only time, and a few more trillion proton collisions, will tell.

T	discovery of the higgs boson a key to open the mysteries of the universe - mercopress
C	- 22:39 utc discovery of the higgs boson a key to open the mysteries of the universe scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. physicist higgs came up with the idea 48 years ago "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle - wire health & science - the sacramento bee
C	geneva -- scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." share

what's cooking? the uk's potential food crisis the sustainable consumption institute research claims food which families now take for granted, such as meat and fresh vegetables, could become too expensive for many if global temperatures rise in line with the current trends and reach 4?c within the lifetime of many people. seabirds study shows plastic pollution reaching surprising levels off coast of pacific northwest plastic pollution off the northwest coast of north america is reaching the level of the notoriously polluted north sea, according to a new study led by a researcher at the university of british columbia. evidence of life on mars could come from martian moon (phys.org) -- a mission to a martian moon could return with alien life, according to experts at purdue university, but don't expect the invasion scenario presented by summer blockbusters like "men in black 3" or "prometheus." a good reason to wake up at dawn summer is a good time to relax, sleep late, enjoy a break from school or work. waking before sunrise is just not done. melting ice the greatest factor in rising sea levels melting glaciers and ice sheets have contributed more to rising sea levels in the past decade than expansion from warming water, according to modelling in the latest report by the antarctic climate and ecosystems (ace) cooperative research centre. pre-industrial emissions still causing temperatures to rise: study a climate model accounting for the carbon dioxide (co2) released into our atmosphere before the industrial revolution has been used to show the detrimental effect of carbon emissions on global temperature in the long-term. scientists identify tropical oceans as 'beating heart' of climate change (phys.org) -- the world's oceans are increasingly pumping tropical warm water towards the poles with important consequences for life on earth, according to a new study. new study sheds new light on planet formation a study published in the july 5 edition of the journal nature is challenging scientists' understanding of planet formation, suggesting that planets might form much faster than previously thought or, alternatively, that stars harboring planets could be far more numerous. this email is a free service of phys.org you received this email because you subscribed to our list. if you no longer want to receive this email use the link below to unsubscribe. you are subscribed as omssgroup.0000@blogger.com

"as a layman, i think we did it," he said. "we've a discovery. we've observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now was a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass. it is mass that combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it. gravity existed even before newton explained it. but now scientists see something much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10-billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has for years been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorise occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said they had both "observed" a new subatomic particle, a boson. dr. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." asked whether the find is a discovery, he answered: "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?'" the leaders of the two cern teams, joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists, each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. dr. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether what has been discovered is indeed the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s. they did that as part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs that was the question on wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," dr. heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson, not the higgs boson."

T	eureka! physicists, including cu-boulder researchers, celebrate evidence of particle - boulder daily camera
C	a file photo from 2007 of the compact muon solenoid, one of two large detectors inside the large hadron collider. cu researchers worked on the creation of the instrument's eyes. (ap) geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. the international research team that has been searching for the higgs boson includes 15 faculty members and students from the university of colorado at boulder. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. the cu team worked on the designing and building one part of the compact muon solenoid, one of two large detectors in the large hadron collider. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." camera staff contributed to this report. copyright 2012 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

"it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything -- we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of key subatomic particle geneva -- to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it 'consistent' with the long-sought we hope you have enjoyed your complimentary access. become a subscriber today to enjoy these benefits: ipad-optimized edition mobile site & iphone app are you currently a subscriber? set up your digital access now. you now have full access. thank you for subscribing. access the tablet-optimized site, mobile site and iphone app share your access with any friend or family member subscriber exclusive top 5 daily email newsletter create an account or if you have a digital profile you must have browser cookies enabled to view our site. it's possible that your browser cookies are turned off. to continue using your current web browser, adobe flash must be installed or upgraded:

T	thespec - scientists discover new particle ?consistent? with...
C	los angeles in a culmination of 50 years of theoretical speculation and three weeks of intense media frenzy, two teams of researchers at the european organization for nuclear research said they had independently discovered evidence for a "higgs-like" boson, the long-sought elementary particle that gives mass to the universe. to thunderous applause from a standing-room-only crowd of physicists and journalists gathered in a large auditorium at cern, as the organization is generally called - as well as from other groups of physicists around the world watching by webcast - the leaders of the two teams said they had definitely observed a boson, and that it just might be the higgs boson that has been the subject of their frantic search. for physicists everywhere, including those in hamilton, it was "a great triumph of human thought," as mcmaster university's itay yavin put it. "to think that something that came out of a piece of paper from a human being thinking deeply about nature, to the point where now we are confirming the existence of this particle," said yavin, an assistant professor and associate member of the perimeter institute for theoretical physics. "to me, that is a grand moment and there aren't too many such moments in science of that magnitude." the discovery is "very, very significant," said physicist joe incandela of the university of california, santa barbara, the lead researcher and spokesman for one of the two teams. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going back to the discovery of quarks, for example." "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," said rolf heuer, cern's director general. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the two teams will now most likely spend many years trying to characterize the properties of the new particle and determine whether it is a unique entity or just one of several different forms of the higgs boson. if there proves to be one and only one higgs boson, its discovery would provide confirmation of the so-called standard model of physics. if there are more than one form, then theorists might have to develop a revised model of how the universe works. quantum theory says that the universe is made of two types of elementary particles, fermions and bosons. fermions are matter, like the electron or the proton. bosons are energy and can transmit forces, like the photon. in 1964, two groups of three theorists each proposed that the universe is pervaded by a molasses-like field, now called the higgs field. as fermions pass through the field, they acquire mass. without the field, the universe would literally fall apart; even atoms would no longer exist. one of the physicists, peter higgs of the university of edinburgh, predicted that if this field were hit by the right amount of energy, it would produce a unique particle, which came to be known as the higgs boson. higgs was present at the cern announcement wednesday and said afterward, "for me, it is an incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime." in his 1993 book, the god particle: if the universe is the answer, what is the question?, nobel laureate leon lederman, head of the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia, ill., half-jokingly coined the term god particle because the higgs boson is so crucial to the existence of the universe. the phrase took hold among the public, but has never been very popular with physicists. detecting a higgs boson is not easy. its lifetime is so short that it cannot be observed directly. instead, researchers can only see its breakdown products, and that is where the uncertainty comes in. some of the particle interactions that would be produced by a higgs disintegration could potentially be produced from other sources as well - which is why the teams had to sift through more than 800 trillion collisions seeking evidence. copyright class action">settlement of canadian copyright class action

T	elusive particle found, looks like higgs boson | michael jackson death hoax investigators - page 1
C	mjkit july 28, 2009 - november 17, 2009 the hindu : sci-tech / science : elusive particle found, looks like higgs boson cern physicists hail evidence of game-changing discovery of subatomic particle scientists at the world's biggest atom smashing facility near here claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle on wednesday. they found it to be "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson, popularly known as the "god particle" that helps explain what gives size and shape to all matter in the universe. graphic: new particle could be higgs boson "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european centre for nuclear research (cern), told scientists amid cheers and standing ovation. "as a layman, i think we did it," he said. "we've a discovery. we've observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now was a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass. it is mass that combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it. gravity existed even before newton explained it. but now scientists see something much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10-billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has for years been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorise occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said they had both "observed" a new subatomic particle, a boson. dr. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." asked whether the find is a discovery, he answered: "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?'" the leaders of the two cern teams, joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists, each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. dr. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether what has been discovered is indeed the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s. they did that as part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs that was the question on wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," dr. heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson, not the higgs boson."

"as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks.

"it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries."

C	after long quest, physicists celebrate evidence of subatomic 'god particle' scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william&mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. ap survey: high us unemployment to persist will into next presidential term after long quest, physicists celebrate evidence of subatomic 'god particle' 17 minutes ago updated wed 11:04pm 18 minutes ago updated wed 11:04pm

T	elusive particle found, looks like higgs boson | michael jackson death hoax investigators - page 1
C	mjkit july 28, 2009 - november 17, 2009 the hindu : sci-tech / science : elusive particle found, looks like higgs boson cern physicists hail evidence of game-changing discovery of subatomic particle scientists at the world's biggest atom smashing facility near here claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle on wednesday. they found it to be "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson, popularly known as the "god particle" that helps explain what gives size and shape to all matter in the universe. graphic: new particle could be higgs boson "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european centre for nuclear research (cern), told scientists amid cheers and standing ovation. "as a layman, i think we did it," he said. "we've a discovery. we've observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now was a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass. it is mass that combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it. gravity existed even before newton explained it. but now scientists see something much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10-billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has for years been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorise occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said they had both "observed" a new subatomic particle, a boson. dr. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." asked whether the find is a discovery, he answered: "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?'" the leaders of the two cern teams, joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists, each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. dr. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether what has been discovered is indeed the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s. they did that as part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs that was the question on wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," dr. heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson, not the higgs boson." "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-km tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as dr. gianotti and dr. incandela each took their turn. dr. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle," and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" dr. gianotti said to laughs, giving credit for the discovery. later, she said that "the standard model [of physics] is not complete," but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way to explain how the subatomic universe works and got started. dr. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted, or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think of how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we've found," he said.

T	it's a boson: higgs quest bears new particle | reuters
C	paradise regained: clayton christensen and the path to salvation geneva (reuters) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the "celebrity" of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. "that is what we are sure is the higgs," a cern scientist said. "it's a boson!" headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the "dramatic 5 sigma signal" for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. "the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful," oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. "we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted." "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: "cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson," he said. "in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs." the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: "we have closed one chapter and opened another," said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: "this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made." higgs himself called it a great achievement for cern's collider. without it, his ideas would remain just a paper theory and he conceded that he personally was never cut out for laboratory experimentation: "i certainly did some lab work as a schoolboy in bristol," he told reuters. "i was incompetent." we welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion, anecdotes, links and data. if you see a comment that you believe is irrelevant or inappropriate, you can flag it to our editors by using the report abuse links. views expressed in the comments do not represent those of reuters. for more information on our comment policy, see but, we won't be able to answer-as of yet- what gave rise to the big bang itself!

T	eureka! after long quest, top physicists celebrate evidence of subatomic 'god particle' | startribune.com
C	geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider.

C	mjkit july 28, 2009 - november 17, 2009 the hindu : sci-tech / science : elusive particle found, looks like higgs boson cern physicists hail evidence of game-changing discovery of subatomic particle scientists at the world's biggest atom smashing facility near here claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle on wednesday. they found it to be "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson, popularly known as the "god particle" that helps explain what gives size and shape to all matter in the universe. graphic: new particle could be higgs boson "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european centre for nuclear research (cern), told scientists amid cheers and standing ovation. "as a layman, i think we did it," he said. "we've a discovery. we've observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now was a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass. it is mass that combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it. gravity existed even before newton explained it. but now scientists see something much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10-billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has for years been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorise occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said they had both "observed" a new subatomic particle, a boson. dr. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." asked whether the find is a discovery, he answered: "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?'" the leaders of the two cern teams, joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists, each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. dr. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether what has been discovered is indeed the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s. they did that as part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs that was the question on wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," dr. heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson, not the higgs boson." "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-km tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as dr. gianotti and dr. incandela each took their turn. dr. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle," and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" dr. gianotti said to laughs, giving credit for the discovery. later, she said that "the standard model [of physics] is not complete," but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way to explain how the subatomic universe works and got started. dr. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted, or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think of how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we've found," he said.

C	related: eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle gallery see all 41 photos ? berlin (ap) -- scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle ? 2012 the associated press . all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. learn more about our privacy policy and terms of use . print print email email this article share tweet share share! x digg delicious myspace linkedin stumbleupon newsvine reddit previous article police seek out drunken drivers during holiday next article woman arrested for allegedly abusing horses

T	physicists find elusive higgs boson, seen as key to universe - nytimes.com
C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to the universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times scientists at the fermilab in batavia, ill., on wednesday watched the presentation about the discovery of the higgs boson, which was shown from geneva. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle - the crescent news
C	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle geneva (ap) -- scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself -- an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle -- a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks.

"it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. by posting to this site, you agree to our

T	for the record: existance of "god" particle confirmed
C	existance of "god" particle confirmed i am reposting this article with little comment. what you want to know now is my take on all of this. well, remember that einstine's "doctrine" is that photons "spontaniously gain mass" from travel, which lack it standing still. to me this violates a basic perameter of basic physics. here is a way perhaps to stick einstein in the trash can and come up with something more sensible. the idea of calling it a "god" particle is intriguing because as you'll only hear right here- - - god is the ultimate materialist being. in fact there is no use for god whatsoever in the psychic, or if you will, the karmic realm. as you know i invoke what i call the 'marcion wall of separation" between the karmic world and the material world. items in the karmic world lack not only mass but also spacial gemoetry as we commonly know it- - and also any sense of "time as a river" but rather view time in pixelated or "moment by monent" form. i wanted to comment on one thing you may be puzzled about before we get to the long article, transcribed with some minimal editing. we talked about meeting other psychic beings in a common "theater". you math whizzes will note that two "planes" meet in a line, so what you want to know is "then you'd be completely "lined in" wouldn't you? no. part of the problem is to keep your "metaphore formats" straight. those "lines" are the "theater" or the football field or the chess board. someone can be in your "theater" you two have in common. you may have a common "theater" with another being at the same time, of course. this would represent- changing the metaphore a bit, to a board game of risk where the troops are different colored pieces. what consists of a dot in one format is a "theater" in another format. you can rightly deduce that you can be at two different intersecting 'lines" (the line is the form intersecting planes take) at the same time. keep in mind- - geometry in the psychic world is not literal spacial geometry as we know it. some of you are also curious about tangents saying "tangents in geometry rise way above one". yes- - - but we here are talking about the "actualization" or "percentage of equity" tangent. this cannot rise above one because the person - - back around 1900 who devised the formula - - made the formula so that it virtually "self destructs" when any entry above one is entered. the formula goes crazy, as you know if you've tried it in excel. therefore since something cannot exist it does not exist- - and you cannot exist above a 45 degree incarnation plane, we have discussed previously. now here is the "god particle' article. more direct application of discovery many have said that this is the "root universe particle". they are in large measure right. for instance the famous "circle" equation in trigonometry is useful because of its close connection to the pythagorean equation, which is useful in a lot of stuff. in the same manner - - - we now have discovered the essential particle of the universe, if i read the media tea leaves right. they say this particle "passes through your fingers like moon light" in kind of a misplaced metaphore. however it is an over-extrapelation to say this particle proves the big bang. the best you can say it is useful to the big bang theory, provided the theory itself is proven. if not proven, then you don't have squat in this regard. in other words the big bang theory is not an "essential aspect of this particle. as i understand however the properties of this particle embody of material space we we know it. this is - - mass, spacial geometry, and gravity. the addage is proven that - - "the nature of mass determines the nature of the space around it. it could be used to explain how photons "slow down" and give the illusion of the expanding universe. if it is an illusion, then the big bang is also an - - illusion. this is my belief. the impitus for the big bang lies on the eronious "meme" or belief that infinity is too big an entity for even god to create. i disagree. back to the whole guitar down tuning thing for a minute- - - which is a ratio of the fourth root of two - - - (to be precise) or the tweith root of two to the third power (also acceptable) the big truth that has gone unspoken here is the cries of nymphomaniacs everywhere. two words: size matters. the god particle explains how a mass-less particle such as the photon can "pick up mass". it merely "snags" a bunch of these "god particles". if these god particles lack the same forward vector as the original photon- - they will have the effect of slowing it down. but this slowing is only noticible after tens of millions of light-years, so it isn't really marked. it could be argued (as least with my prejudice) that only a mass-less particle is effected by the "viscosity" (there's that word again) of these god particles. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle.

"what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which costs $10 billion to build only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." i just talked to pete richards on the phone and we managed to have a nice 45 minute conversation without disintegrating each other with our star wars weapons. we did a pretty good job of avoiding politics. today one individual made an ass of himself, and he's a friend of mine so i don't want to name him. he spoke of being in the "war" and fighting the dictator chang chi check. i think he meant ho chi min - - because i was wondering "when did we ever fight in taiwhan?" then he spoke of having this president obama and saying "thank god we have an election process here because we don't have to put up with all of this shit that president obama is always pulling". if he thinks he's honoring us troops by denigrating a sitting us president, he is not. by the way thom hartman says that supreme court justice samual p chase or whatever- - - openly campaigned for john adams in 1796 the year he was chosen for chief justice or whatever of the high court. but he then went on to openly criticize a sitting us president, thomas jefferson in this case- - by saying that he's one of those subversive republicans ( ) who wants to extending voting rights to all white men, which would completely undermine our whole way of life in this country. congress didn't take kindly to the denegration of a us president and the house voted to impeach a sitting justice for the only time in our history- - but the impeachment vote failed to get a two-thirds vote in the us senate.

T	eureka! after long quest, top physicists celebrate evidence of subatomic 'god particle' | startribune.com
C	geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider.

T	::news4u:: ? physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle'
C	physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle' news4u-news desk - geneva: to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle on wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the " god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universesize and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of theeuropean center for nuclear research(cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said on wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "what do we have?" the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question on wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-km underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. meta itemprop="description" content="news4u-news desk- geneva: to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle on wednesday, calling it "consistent" with t...">

C	print discovery of 'god particle' may explain how world came to exist what is it? modern physics presumes everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. in the 1960s, british physicist peter higgs and others theorized that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. wow, no comments yet....hmmm....kim kardashian is getting married! los angeles - in a culmination of 50 years of theoretical speculation and three weeks of intense media frenzy, two teams of researchers at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) wednesday said they had independently discovered evidence for a "higgs-like" boson, the long-sought elementary particle that gives mass to the universe. to thunderous applause from a standing-room-only crowd of physicists and journalists gathered in a large auditorium at cern, as the organization is known - as well as from other groups of physicists around the world watching by webcast - the leaders of the two teams said they had definitely observed a boson, that it is a higgs boson, and that it might be the higgs boson that has been the subject of their frantic search. whichever it is, the discovery is "very, very significant," said physicist joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, the lead researcher and spokesman for one of the two teams. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going back to the discovery of quarks, for example." "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," said rolf heuer, cern's director general. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the two teams will now most likely spend many years trying to characterize the properties of the new particle and determine whether it is a unique entity or just one of several different forms of the higgs boson. if there proves to be one and only one higgs boson, its discovery would provide confirmation of the so-called standard model of physics. if there are more than one form, then theorists might have to develop a revised model of how the universe works. quantum theory says that the universe is made of two types of elementary particles, fermions and bosons. fermions are matter, like the electron or the proton. bosons are energy and can transmit forces, like the photon. in 1964, two groups of three theorists each proposed that the universe is pervaded by a molasses-like field, now called the higgs field. as fermions pass through the field, they acquire mass. without the field, the universe would literally fall apart; even atoms would no longer exist. one of the physicists, peter higgs, of the university of edinburgh, predicted that if this field were hit by the right amount of energy, it would produce a unique particle, which came to be known as the higgs boson. higgs was present at the cern announcement wednesday and said afterward: "for me, it is an incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime." in his 1993 book, "the god particle: if the universe is the answer, what is the question?" nobel laureate leon lederman, head of the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia, ill., half-jokingly coined the term "god particle" because the higgs boson is so crucial to the existence of the universe. the phrase took hold among the public, but has never been very popular with physicists. theory predicted that the higgs boson should be very heavy, but not precisely how heavy. to produce heavy particles requires large amounts of energy, and most early accelerators could not achieve them, although researchers using the tevatron at fermilab last week said they had seen hints of the higgs boson. the $10 billion large hadron collider at cern was constructed in large part to produce the high energies required. protons are whipped around the 17-mile ring on the border of france and switzerland at relativistic speeds (near the speed of light), colliding with each other in detection chambers operated by two teams, one called atlas and one called cms. the teams have sifted through more than 800 trillion collisions looking for the higgs. but detecting a higgs boson is not easy. its lifetime is so short that it cannot be observed directly. instead, researchers can only see its breakdown products, and that is where the uncertainty comes in. some of the particle interactions that would be produced by a higgs disintegration could potentially be produced from other sources as well - which is why the teams had to look at so many collisions. ultimately, the cms team said it had identified a boson with a mass of 125.3 billion electron volts, about 100 times the mass of a proton. the atlas team said it had seen a mass of 126 billion electron volts. both observations are now at what researchers call the five-sigma level, which means that there is only about one chance in 3.5 million that the results are produced by chance. shot 'out of nowhere' felled city's 22nd homicide victim, sherry soth arrest in king county after elderly woman is bilked of $1 million

"we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the two teams will now most likely spend many years trying to characterize the properties of the new particle and determine whether it is a unique entity or just one of several different forms of the higgs boson. if there proves to be one and only one higgs boson, its discovery would provide confirmation of the so-called standard model of physics. if there are more than one form, then theorists might have to develop a revised model of how the universe works. quantum theory says that the universe is made of two types of elementary particles, fermions and bosons. fermions are matter, like the electron or the proton. bosons are energy and can transmit forces, like the photon. in 1964, two groups of three theorists each proposed that the universe is pervaded by a molasses-like field, now called the higgs field. as fermions pass through the field, they acquire mass. without the field, the universe would literally fall apart; even atoms would no longer exist. one of the physicists, peter higgs, of the university of edinburgh, predicted that if this field were hit by the right amount of energy, it would produce a unique particle, which came to be known as the higgs boson. higgs was present at the cern announcement wednesday and said afterward: "for me, it is an incredible thing that has happened in my lifetime." in his 1993 book, "the god particle: if the universe is the answer, what is the question?" nobel laureate leon lederman, head of the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia, ill., half-jokingly coined the term "god particle" because the higgs boson is so crucial to the existence of the universe. the phrase took hold among the public, but has never been very popular with physicists. theory predicted that the higgs boson should be very heavy, but not precisely how heavy. to produce heavy particles requires large amounts of energy, and most early accelerators could not achieve them, although researchers using the tevatron at fermilab last week said they had seen hints of the higgs boson. the $10 billion large hadron collider at cern was constructed in large part to produce the high energies required. protons are whipped around the 17-mile ring on the border of france and switzerland at relativistic speeds (near the speed of light), colliding with each other in detection chambers operated by two teams, one called atlas and one called cms. the teams have sifted through more than 800 trillion collisions looking for the higgs. but detecting a higgs boson is not easy. its lifetime is so short that it cannot be observed directly. instead, researchers can only see its breakdown products, and that is where the uncertainty comes in. some of the particle interactions that would be produced by a higgs disintegration could potentially be produced from other sources as well - which is why the teams had to look at so many collisions. ultimately, the cms team said it had identified a boson with a mass of 125.3 billion electron volts, about 100 times the mass of a proton. the atlas team said it had seen a mass of 126 billion electron volts. both observations are now at what researchers call the five-sigma level, which means that there is only about one chance in 3.5 million that the results are produced by chance. shot 'out of nowhere' felled city's 22nd homicide victim, sherry soth arrest in king county after elderly woman is bilked of $1 million

T	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to the universe
C	conservative refocus published on july 4th, 2012 @ 09:48:06 pm , using 1623 words aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which costs $10 billion to build only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data presented in graphs with bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti noted that the mass of the putative higgs, apparently one of the heaviest subatomic particles, made it easy to study its many behaviors. "thanks, nature," she said. gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause, like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime," he said. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented what came to be known as the higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and fran?ois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough with the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen possible ways, depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not describe how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find, eluding researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare in abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the "goddamn particle.") finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly. so far, the physicists admit, they know little about their new boson. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the boson while others might be underproducing it, clues that maybe there is more at work here than the standard model would predict. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said guido tonelli of cern. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team of physicists, said: "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." remember me (name, email & website)

"it's a gigantic triumph for physics," said frank wilczek, an mit physicist and nobel laureate. "it's a tremendous demonstration of a community dedicated to understanding nature." the achievement, nearly 50 years in the making, confirms physicists' understanding of how mass - the stuff that makes stars, planets and even people - arose in the universe, they said. it also points the way toward a new path of scientific inquiry into the mass-generating mechanism that was never before possible, said ucla physicist robert cousins, a member of one of the two research teams that have been chasing the higgs boson at cern. "i compare it to turning the corner and walking around a building - there's a whole new set of things you can look at," he said. "it is a beginning, not an end." leaders of the two teams reported independent results that suggested the existence of a previously unseen subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 billion to 126 billion electron volts. both groups got results at a "five sigma" level of confidence - the statistical requirement for declaring a scientific "discovery." "the chance that either of the two experiments had seen a fluke is less than three parts in 10 million," said uc san diego physicist vivek sharma, a former leader of one of the higgs research groups. "there is no doubt that we have found something." but he and others stopped just shy of saying that this new particle was indeed the long-sought higgs boson. "all we can tell right now is that it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck," sharma said. in this case, quacking was enough for most.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle | world news | the guardian
C	john heilprin associated press= geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. syria crisis: turkey finds bodies of downed pilots - wednesday 4 july 2012 in the moment by tom jenkins ?20.00

C	enlarge this undated image made available by cern shows a typical candidate event including two high-energy photons whose energy (depicted by red towers) is measured in the cms electromagnetic calorimeter. the yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision. the pale blue volume shows the cms crystal calorimeter barrel. (ap photo/cern) scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the higgs boson anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research , have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super- symmetry " where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern . scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. copyright 2012 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. 0 share to facebook physorg.com on fb tweet physorg.com on twitter reddit delicious yahoo! bookmarks rss qr code view popular send feedback to editors 5 /5 (6 votes) 1 2 3 4 5

T	yes, scientists exclaim, there is a 'god particle' | startribune.com
C	long-sought higgs boson seen as key to understanding how universe works. a half-century scientific quest culminated on wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle -- one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson -- or the "god particle," to the chagrin of scientists -- the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle in geneva. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," said heuer. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. moments later, higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution -- a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" -- scientists around the world celebrated the moment. a video feed from melbourne, australia, where an international physics conference is set to begin, showed an auditorium packed with cheering scientists. 'it's incredible' at fermilab, long-time home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," said lincoln. "people were riveted. discovery is what scientists live for." at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared a bottle of champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts, one of the more than 6,000 scientists who contributed to the discovery. "i'm still astonished that at 3 a.m. on the fourth of july you can gather" so many people excited about the arcane field of subatomic physics, tuts said. with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 -- set two years ago -- cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the huge large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found -- and the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe -- protons, neutrons, electrons and so on -- interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more massive objects get tangled up in the field -- and hence, slowed down as they move -- more than less massive objects. searching for clues the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of criss-crossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. two independent teams, working on two separate particle detectors, arrived at similar results -- a kind of cross-check. the two teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not to share their results with each other before wednesday. to find this tiny particle, scientists built the biggest of machines -- a 17-mile ring under the french-swiss border called the large hadron collider. at two points along the ring, they installed cathedral-sized detectors that capture traces of high-energy collisions of protons. inside this subatomic wreckage, both detectors saw evidence for the missing subatomic particle. the idea of the higgs, or something like it, has been around since 1964, when it was first hypothesized by peter higgs. the standard model of physics had a hole in it -- one that needed to be filled by a particle that imbues everything with mass. it became known as the higgs boson -- and its discovery, many scientists say, will now surely garner a nobel prize. mass is not the same thing as weight, although the two concepts are easily confused. an object has mass even in outer space. mass is an object's resistance to being shoved around -- its inertia. ordinary matter that comprises the bulk of stars, planets and human beings is relatively massive. the most massive particles move like someone trying to walk through neck-high water. this notion of a field that gives particles mass has been essential to understanding the way the universe is put together. the discovery of the higgs is the latest reminder that the universe can be understood through mathematics. britain's peter higgs, right, theorized the existence of the exotic particle in 1964. denis balibouse, associated press

C	home signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider, the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality.

"i think we have it," rolf-?dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. heuer and others said it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the past half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists because they could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, a spokesman for one of two groups reporting data, called the discovery "very, very significant." "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example," he said. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say, all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. but detecting a higgs boson is not easy. its lifetime is so short that it cannot be observed directly. instead, researchers can only see its breakdown products, and that is where the uncertainty comes in. some of the particle interactions that would be produced by a higgs disintegration could potentially be produced from other sources as well, which is why the teams had to look at so many collisions. physicists said they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." the announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which smashes protons into each other. the collider has been running for just two years, and only at about half its maximum theoretical power. it was scheduled to be shut down in october for two years of maintenance, but heuer said it will now run until the end of the year so that teams can gather more data on the new particle. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe," heuer said. 5th annual bug festival at zilker park

T	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe - nytimes.com
C	aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the fabrice coffrini/agence france-presse - getty images the british physicist peter higgs arrived at cern's headquarters on wednesday. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

T	the himalayan times - "it's a boson": higgs quest bears new particle - detail news
C	last updated at: 2012-07-05 8:39 am the himalayan times - saved articles(s) joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, addresses a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research in meyrin near geneva on july 4, 2012. geneva: scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. "nobel prizes all round." higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. end of an era "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who laboured on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honour of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the "celebrity" of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. "that is what we are sure is the higgs," a cern scientist said. less than one in a million "it's a boson!" headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the "dramatic 5 sigma signal" for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. "the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful," oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. "we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted." "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: "cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson," he said. "in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: "we have closed one chapter and opened another," said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: "this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made."

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle - wire health & science - the sacramento bee
C	geneva -- scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." share

T	physicists are celebrating their higgs boson 'triumph' | mcclatchy
C	los angeles - for physicists, it was a moment like landing on the moon or the discovery of dna. the focus was the higgs boson, a subatomic particle that exists for a mere fraction of a second. long theorized but never glimpsed, the so-called god particle is thought to be key to understanding the existence of all mass in the universe. the revelation wednesday that it - or some version of it - had almost certainly been detected amid more than hundreds of trillions of high-speed collisions in a 17-mile track near geneva prompted a group of normally reserved scientists to erupt with joy. peter higgs, one of the scientists who first hypothesized the existence of the particle, reportedly shed tears as the data were presented in a jam-packed and applause-heavy seminar at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. "it's a gigantic triumph for physics," said frank wilczek, an mit physicist and nobel laureate. "it's a tremendous demonstration of a community dedicated to understanding nature." the achievement, nearly 50 years in the making, confirms physicists' understanding of how mass - the stuff that makes stars, planets and even people - arose in the universe, they said. it also points the way toward a new path of scientific inquiry into the mass-generating mechanism that was never before possible, said university of california, los angeles physicist robert cousins, a member of one of the two research teams that has been chasing the higgs boson at cern. "i compare it to turning the corner and walking around a building - there's a whole new set of things you can look at," he said. "it is a beginning, not an end." leaders of the two teams reported independent results that suggested the existence of a previously unseen subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 to 126 billion electron volts. both groups got results at a "five sigma" level of confidence - the statistical requirement for declaring a scientific "discovery." "the chance that either of the two experiments had seen a fluke is less than three parts in 10 million," said university of california, san diego physicist vivek sharma, a former leader of one of the higgs research groups. "there is no doubt that we have found something." but he and others stopped just shy of saying that this new particle was indeed the long-sought higgs boson. "all we can tell right now is that it quacks like a duck and it walks like a duck," sharma said. in this case, quacking was enough for most. "if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably at least a bird," said wilczek, who stayed up past 3 a.m. to watch the seminar live over the web while vacationing in new hampshire. certainly cern leaders in geneva, even as they referred to their discovery simply as "a new particle," didn't bother hiding their excitement. the original plan had been to present the latest results on the higgs search at the international conference on high energy physics, a big scientific meeting that began wednesday in melbourne, australia. but as it dawned on cern scientists that they were on the verge of "a big announcement," cousins said, officials decided to honor tradition and instead present the results on cern's turf. the small number of scientists who theorized the existence of the higgs boson in the 1960s - including higgs of the university of edinburgh - were invited to fly to geneva. for the non-vip set, lines to get into the auditorium began forming late tuesday. many spent the night in sleeping bags. all the hubbub was due to the fact that the discovery of the higgs boson is the last piece of the puzzle needed to complete the so-called standard model of particle physics - the big picture that describes the subatomic particles that make up everything in the universe, and the forces that work between them. over the course of the 20th century, as physicists learned more about the standard model, they struggled to answer one very basic question: why does matter exist? higgs and others came up with a possible explanation: that particles gain mass by traveling through an energy field. one way to think about it is that the field sticks to the particles, slowing them down and imparting mass. that energy field came to be known as the higgs field. the particle associated with the field was dubbed the higgs boson. higgs published his theory in 1964. in the 48 years since, physicists have eagerly chased the higgs boson. finding it would provide the experimental confirmation they needed to show that their current understanding of the standard model was correct. on the other hand, ruling it out would mean a return to the drawing board to look for an alternative higgs particle, or several alternative higgs particles, or perhaps to rethink the standard model from the bottom up. either outcome would be monumental, scientists said. but the search hasn't been easy. to create exotic subatomic particles for study, physicists use huge colliders to smash bits of atoms together. cern built its $10 billion large hadron collider in large part to produce a particle as massive as the higgs boson was expected to be; no other collider in the world was up to the task. the lhc, as it's known, shoots beams of protons around a 17-mile circular track underground - accelerating them nearly to the speed of light and crashing them together to create bursts of subatomic particles. scientists on the two research teams - known as cms and atlas - use two different detectors to analyze the patterns formed by the particles. if a higgs boson were to be created, it would decay immediately into one of several combinations of other particles, theorists have suggested. these combinations are what scientists search for in the 800 trillion proton-proton collisions recorded at the lhc. in december, cern announced that both teams had uncovered "tantalizing hints" of a higgs boson with a mass of about 125 billion electron volts. physicists said they didn't expect wednesday's announcement to come so soon, and that the collider's performance had exceeded all expectations. "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged," higgs said in a statement. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime." john gunion, a theoretical physicist at the university of california, davis and co-author of a book called "the higgs hunter's guide," said he was satisfied that the new particle was associated with the production of mass in the universe in the moments after the big bang. the next step, he and others said, would be to figure out whether the particle is indeed the single higgs boson described by the standard model or some exotic variant. proponents of a theory known as supersymmetry, for instance, believe that there are multiple higgs bosons. "there's plenty of room for surprising details," said wilczek, a supersymmetry fan. in the meantime, physicists at cern won't get much of a chance to enjoy their party. cousins said that he was already doing mop-up work, putting together documentation that normally would have appeared at the same time as the seminar. many of his cern colleagues hopped on planes to attend the conference in melbourne. others will keep their eyes on their computer screens and continue studying collisions. the next phase of data collection for the higgs search, which had been scheduled to wrap up in october, will now run into december, sharma said. that should give cern scientists three times more collisions to study than the 800 trillion they've already amassed. "we are in hot pursuit," he said. "you push it as much as you can." but even that won't be enough to reveal definitively the true nature of the new particle, he added. after december, the lhc will go dark for two years while its equipment gets an upgrade. then it will pick up the search where it left off.

T	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe - nytimes.com
C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to the universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times scientists at the fermilab in batavia, ill., on wednesday watched the presentation about the discovery of the higgs boson, which was shown from geneva. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

T	the himalayan times - "it's a boson": higgs quest bears new particle - detail news
C	last updated at: 2012-07-05 8:39 am the himalayan times - saved articles(s) joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, addresses a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research in meyrin near geneva on july 4, 2012. geneva: scientists at europe's cern research centre have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. "nobel prizes all round." higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. end of an era "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who laboured on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honour of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the "celebrity" of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. "that is what we are sure is the higgs," a cern scientist said. less than one in a million "it's a boson!" headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the "dramatic 5 sigma signal" for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. "the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful," oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. "we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted." "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: "cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson," he said. "in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: "we have closed one chapter and opened another," said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: "this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made."

T	my own thoughts: the god particle - simply explained
C	the discovery of higg's boson (the god particle) our understanding of physics accelerated throughout the 20th century with theories on the big bang, inflation and the inflaton field, string theory, m-theory, supersymmetry, quantum mechanics, parallel worlds, bubble universes and much more. it's truly fascinating to observe all this as a conscious being sitting inside the very universe we're all trying to figure out, and one thing i really appreciate about physicists in general is that they require an extraordinarily convincing burden of proof before they announce something to be "discovered." this is why physicists, chemists and other "hard sciences" people who end up throwing their hats in with the pharmaceutical / vaccine / chemotherapy industries only end up discrediting themselves. the for-profit health care industry is largely based on quackery that merely borrows the label of "science" but follows none of its stringent requirements for proof. physics and cosmology, in great contrast, has (almost) nothing to patent and nothing to sell to the public at monopolistic prices. particle physics, cosmology and even quantum field theory is truly all about the quest for knowledge and not about hyping up some false pandemic to sell more dangerous vaccines to an unsuspecting public. even with the extreme attention to evidentiary detail, however, there's still something the physicists have been overlooking for a long, long time: consciousness. the quest for particles why would anyone want to spend a few billion dollars smashing atoms together and analyzing the results of the splatter? to find out what atoms are made of, of course. but more importantly, to find out what the universe is made of. that's what cern is all about, and as long as its results are understood in the proper context, it's valuable science. there's a huge gap in all this, unfortunately, and that gap has its origins in the thinking that atoms are made entirely of particles. the wildly misnamed "god particle" known as higgs boson has been the single most sought-after particle by physicists in their quest to find physical evidence to back up their mathematical equations of the "standard model" of the universe. to understand why that matters, let's back up for a minute. physicists and especially cosmologists spend an enormous amount of time working in the abstract realm of mathematics. the purpose of the mathematics is to attempt to model physical reality, which is, of course, engineered into the fabric of the universe with the language of mathematics. (consciousness is also woven into the fabric of reality, many argue, but that's a subject i'll revisit later.) what's often lacking in this scientific quest is physical experimental evidence that backs up the math. so it only makes sense to attempt to conduct real-world experiments to either prove or disprove what the theory predicts. that's what cern is all about. now that the higgs particle has been convincingly demonstrated to exist, this helps nail down all sorts of answers, thereby leading to a deeper exploration of other questions, each of which grants a measure of understanding to human civilization. ultimately, physicists are attempting to understand the origins of the universe , which has turned out to be a tricky question for lots of reasons, some of which are almost impossible to imagine. in addition to the parallel worlds and multiverse theories that have joined the complexities, there is also "brane theory" to deal with. it's a theory that says, in a nutshell, multiple universes coexist intertwined with each other but not interacting. you can't touch another brane world even though it may exist right alongside our own brane world. what's important to realize in all this is that even the so-called "standard model" of explaining everything is currently an unsatisfactory patchwork of equations and mathematical transformations that don't play well together when it comes to different physical contexts such as really small things or really large, massive things. try to meld large-scale equations of gravity, for example, with really small phenomena such as quantum fluctuations of atomic nuclei, and you get nonsensical mathematical answers such as "the answer is x divided by zero!" virtually all present-day reality modeling equations break down at singularity events such as black holes, too. the standard model is seriously lacking, in other words, and one of the reasons there is so much excitement about higgs boson is because it would help fill in the gaps of the standard model explanation. the telegraph news item new delhi, july 4: scientists today announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that seems to behave like the higgs boson, the last piece of an elegant theory of the building blocks of the universe predicted 48 years ago but never seen. the particle detected in a laboratory in geneva has signatures remarkably similar to those expected from the higgs boson, sometimes dubbed the god particle. but the scientists have not yet named it as they want to be sure that it isn't an imposter. two experimental teams at the european organisation for nuclear research, or cern, today reported that they have independently observed a particle that has a mass about 126 times that of a proton. both research teams detected its signatures in the tumultuous debris of subatomic particles created during proton-proton collisions in cern's giant particle accelerator called the large hadron collider. "we have a discovery," rolf heuer, the cern director-general said, moments after a researcher from each team presented the findings at a seminar this morning. "we have observation of a new particle consistent with the higgs boson," heuer said. scientists have been looking for the higgs boson for more than two decades, using particle accelerators and high energy subatomic particle collisions to experimentally confirm the particle british physicist peter higgs had proposed in 1964. the higgs boson is the last missing piece of the standard model theory of physics that explains almost all the properties of fundamental particles and forces of nature, except gravity. but the standard model doesn't explain how particles have mass. "this is why the higgs hypothesis is so important to us," said ashutosh kotwal, an india-born physicist at duke university in the us, who leads a higgs search team at atlas, one of the two experiments at lhc. "it solves one of the biggest mysteries in physics - how the fundamental particles acquire mass. without mass, we can't imagine the universe as we know it. our very existence thus depends on the higgs," kotwal said tonight. in december 2011, cern teams had said that they had found tantalising hints of the higgs boson but declared that their results were inconclusive. physicists involved in the higgs search said the results presented today suggest that the chance that the signals of the new particle observed is due to an error or statistical fluctuations is less than 3 in 10 million. "we've found evidence for a unique particle that roughly fits the description of the higgs boson," said vivek sharma, an india-educated physicist at the university of california, san diego, who has been involved in the search for the higgs at the lhc through the second experiment called cms. "in us hunting circles, there's a saying that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck. but that's not the way science advances. we need more evidence to say for certain that this is indeed the higgs boson of the standard model. it's like using genetic fingerprints to show it's a duck," sharma said. the search for the higgs boson is among the longest-running and most expensive of scientific endeavours, an international effort with researchers from over 40 countries, including india, helping design, build, and conduct experiments at the lhc. "it's an emotional moment. today's results are the culmination of 20 years of efforts," said fabiola gianotti, an italian physicist who presented the results from atlas today. "but it's also a starting point for more research," gianotti told the telegraph . in the coming months, researchers hope to continue using collision data from the lhc to determine the precise nature of the new particle, specifically investigate whether its behaviour perfectly matches what the standard model theory has predicted. the higgs boson which belongs to a class of particles named after the 20th century indian physicist satyendra nath bose, has only a fleeting existence and decays through multiple routes, or channels - disintegrating into energy or other subatomic particles. the standard model theory predicts the ratios of these multiple decay channels and scientists plan to spend the next several months trying to determine whether the new particle satisfies these rules. physicists believe that other particles - imposters - may also mimic the higgs boson. "we're now asking: is this the higgs boson predicted by the standard model, or could this be the lightest of five higgs bosons predicted by the theory called super-symmetry, an extension of the standard model?" said sudeshna banerjee, a physicist at the tata institute of fundamental research, mumbai, who's looking for evidence for physics beyond the standard model at the lhc. whatever the answer that emerges in the future, scientists were celebrating today. "it's a fantastic day for science," said sharma. "this is potentially a historic and profound step forward in our understanding of the underlying structure of our universe," said joe incandela, a senior physicist from the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for the cms experiment. the possibility that the new particle might not turn out to be the higgs boson predicted by the standard model doesn't seem to be worrying physicists. "we are happiest when nature throws surprises at us," said kotwal. "a variant of the higgs boson would mean new physics and new particles," said andy lankford, a physicist from the university of california, irvine, and deputy spokesperson for the atlas experiment. the hindu writes at the large hadron collider (lhc), two counter-rotating beams of protons accelerated to high energy are made to collide head-on to result in the creation of myriad particles, known and unknown. from the debris of trillions of such collisions, scientists look for signals characteristic of processes involving the higgs boson. higgs is a very short-lived particle with a lifetime of only about ten-thousandth of a billionth of a second. once created, the higgs boson will immediately decay into several channels and experiments analyse the final products of such decays and see if these really came from the decay of a higgs boson. what makes this task really tough is to be able to pick the right events from a large background of other processes from known physics that mimic the decay of higgs. a signal for higgs means that, in a plot of events observed, a bump sticks out above the large background from other mimicking processes. but such excess of events should be statistically significant to be ascribed to a new entity such as higgs. that is, the bump should not be explainable by statistical fluctuation in the background if there were no higgs, and it is indeed due to processes involving higgs. statistical significance is measured in terms of what is called standard deviation (called sigma). for any discovery in particle physics, the signal should be at least at '5 sigma level' over the background, which is equivalent to one in 3.5 million chance of the bump being due to statistical fluctuation. the large hadron collider our understanding of the universe is about to change... the large hadron collider (lhc) is a gigantic scientific instrument near geneva, where it spans the border between switzerland and france about 100m underground. it is a particle accelerator used by physicists to study the smallest known particles - the fundamental building blocks of all things. it will revolutionise our understanding, from the minuscule world deep within atoms to the vastness of the universe. two beams of subatomic particles called "hadrons" - either protons or lead ions - travel in opposite directions inside the circular accelerator, gaining energy with every lap. physicists use the lhc to recreate the conditions just after the big bang, by colliding the two beams head-on at very high energy. teams of physicists from around the world then analyse the particles created in the collisions using special detectors in a number of experiments dedicated to the lhc. what happens inside the large hadron collider. there are many theories as to what will result from these collisions. for decades, the standard model of particle physics has served physicists well as a means of understanding the fundamental laws of nature, but it does not tell the whole story. only experimental data using the high energies reached by the lhc can push knowledge forward, challenging those who seek confirmation of established knowledge, and those who dare to dream beyond the paradigm. bbc reports 'dramatic' the cms team claimed they had seen a "bump" in their data corresponding to a particle weighing in at 125.3 gigaelectronvolts (gev) - about 133 times heavier than the protons that lie at the heart of every atom. the bbc's george alagiah explains the higgs boson they claimed that by combining two data sets, they had attained a confidence level just at the "five-sigma" point - about a one-in-3.5 million chance that the signal they see would appear if there were no higgs particle. however, a full combination of the cms data brings that number just back to 4.9 sigma - a one-in-two million chance. prof joe incandela, spokesman for the cms, was unequivocal: "the results are preliminary but the five-sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle," he told the geneva meeting. atlas results were even more promising, at a slightly higher mass: "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of five sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev," said dr fabiola gianotti, spokeswoman for the atlas experiment at the lhc. peter higgs joined three of the six theoreticians who first predicted the higgs at the conference prof rolf heuer, director-general of cern, commented: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it." "we have a discovery - we have observed a new particle consistent with a higgs boson. but which one? that remains open. "it is a historic milestone but it is only the beginning." commenting on the emotions of the scientists involved in the discovery, prof incandela said: "it didn't really hit me emotionally until today because we have to be so focussed? but i'm super-proud." dr gianotti echoed his thoughts, adding: "the last few days have been extremely intense, full of work, lots of emotions." a confirmation that this is the higgs boson would be one of the biggest scientific discoveries of the century; the hunt for the higgs has been compared by some physicists to the apollo programme that reached the moon in the 1960s. scientists will have to look at how the higgs decays - or transforms - into other, more stable particles after being produced in collisions at the lhc. dr pippa wells, a member of the atlas experiment, said that several of the decay paths already showed deviations from what one would expect of the standard model higgs. for example, a decay path where the higgs transforms into two photon particles was "a bit on the high side", she explained. these could get back into line as more statistics are added, but on the other hand, they may not. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe at a level we've never done before," said prof incandela. "we're on the frontier now, on the edge of a new exploration. this could be the only part of the story that's left, or we could open a whole new realm of discovery." the standard model and the higgs boson ? the standard model is the simplest set of ingredients - elementary particles - needed to make up the world we see in the heavens and in the laboratory ? quarks combine together to make, for example, the proton and neutron - which make up the nuclei of atoms today - though more exotic combinations were around in the universe's early days ? leptons come in charged and uncharged versions; electrons - the most familiar charged lepton - together with quarks make up all the matter we can see; the uncharged leptons are neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter ? the "force carriers" are particles whose movements are observed as familiar forces such as those behind electricity and light (electromagnetism) and radioactive decay (the weak nuclear force) ? the higgs boson came about because although the standard model holds together neatly, nothing requires the particles to have mass; for a fuller theory, the higgs - or something else - must fill in that gap higgs boson simply explained in the video below see this animation posted by kanti pal at 9:09 am no comments: post a comment
Q	discovered.
Q	hard sciences
Q	science
Q	god particle
Q	standard model
Q	brane theory
Q	standard model
Q	the answer is x divided by zero!
Q	we have a discovery,
Q	we have observation of a new particle consistent with the higgs boson,
Q	this is why the higgs hypothesis is so important to us,
Q	it solves one of the biggest mysteries in physics - how the fundamental particles acquire mass. without mass, we can't imagine the universe as we know it. our very existence thus depends on the higgs,
Q	we've found evidence for a unique particle that roughly fits the description of the higgs boson,
Q	in us hunting circles, there's a saying that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck. but that's not the way science advances. we need more evidence to say for certain that this is indeed the higgs boson of the standard model. it's like using genetic fingerprints to show it's a duck,
Q	it's an emotional moment. today's results are the culmination of 20 years of efforts,
Q	but it's also a starting point for more research,
Q	we're now asking: is this the higgs boson predicted by the standard model, or could this be the lightest of five higgs bosons predicted by the theory called super-symmetry, an extension of the standard model?
Q	it's a fantastic day for science,
Q	this is potentially a historic and profound step forward in our understanding of the underlying structure of our universe,
Q	we are happiest when nature throws surprises at us,
Q	a variant of the higgs boson would mean new physics and new particles,
Q	hadrons
Q	bump
Q	five-sigma
Q	the results are preliminary but the five-sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle,
Q	we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of five sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev,
Q	as a layman i would now say i think we have it.
Q	we have a discovery - we have observed a new particle consistent with a higgs boson. but which one? that remains open.
Q	it didn't really hit me emotionally until today because we have to be so focussed? but i'm super-proud.
Q	the last few days have been extremely intense, full of work, lots of emotions.
Q	a bit on the high side
Q	we're reaching into the fabric of the universe at a level we've never done before,
Q	we're on the frontier now, on the edge of a new exploration. this could be the only part of the story that's left, or we could open a whole new realm of discovery.

T	higgs boson -- the 'god particle' -- finding hailed by cern scientists in geneva | masslive.com
C	associated press this image provided by cern shows a real cms proton-proton collision in which 4 high energy electrons (green lines and red towers) are observed. the event shows characteristics expected from the decay of a higgs boson but is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday july 4, 2012, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson ??" popularly known as the "god particle" ??" that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. (ap photo/cern) by john heilprin geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson , or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. associated press participants applaud after a results presentation during a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin near geneva july 4, 2012. the head of the world's biggest atom smasher is claiming discovery of a new particle that he says is consistent with the long-sought higgs boson known popularly as the "god particle" which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. (ap photo/denis balibouse, pool) each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries."

T	scientists discover subatomic particle at the center of everything | tbo.com
C	a half-century scientific quest culminated wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson, or god particle, it is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research. he made the statement after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in geneva. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of the particle in 1964, teared up. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime," higgs said. as late as tuesday, two teams of scientists pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs. * * * * * the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found. the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist. "this is why (nobel prize-winning physicist) leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. mass is not the same as weight, though the two concepts are easily confused. an object has mass even in outer space. mass is an object's resistance to being shoved around - its inertia. ordinary matter that makes up the bulk of stars, planets and human beings is relatively massive. the most massive particles move like someone trying to walk through neck-high water. this notion of a field that gives particles mass has been essential to understanding the way the universe is put together. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. * * * * * the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of criss-crossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. two independent teams, working on two separate particle detectors, arrived at similar results in a kind of cross-check. the two teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not allowed to share their results with each other before the seminar at cern on wednesday. to find this tiny particle, scientists built the large hadron collider, a 17-mile ring under the french-swiss border. at two points along the ring, they installed cathedral-size detectors that capture traces of high-energy collisions of protons. inside this subatomic wreckage, both detectors saw evidence for a subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 giga-electron volts, or about 125 times the mass of a proton. cern announced last december that it was homing in on the higgs, but cautioned that it needed a new batch of high-energy collisions to gain confidence that scientists were seeing something real, not a random bump in data.

T	higgs boson particle discovered at cern | world news | bradenton herald
C	by john heilprin - associated press geneva -- scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself -- an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs bo son was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle -- a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." medical braden river care center

T	physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson
C	california institute of technology physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson international consortium of scientists includes a large caltech contingent pasadena, calif.-physicists at the large hadron collider (lhc) in geneva, switzerland, have discovered a new particle that may be the long-sought higgs boson, the fundamental particle that is thought to endow elementary particles with mass. "this is a momentous time in the history of particle physics and in scientific exploration-the implications are profound," says harvey newman, professor of physics at the california institute of technology (caltech). "this is experimental science at its best." the international team of scientists and engineers-which includes a large contingent from caltech, led by newman and maria spiropulu, professor of physics-says it needs more data to determine for certain if the particle they've discovered is indeed the higgs boson predicted by the standard model, the theory that describes how all particles interact. the results so far, however, show that it has many of the properties expected for such a particle. "one of the most exciting aspects of this observation is that the road remains open for a vast range of 'lookalike' alternatives, where any deviation from the standard model would point the way to the existence of other new particles or forces of nature," newman says. regardless of the exact identity of the new particle, cern's scientists say, the highly anticipated discovery heralds a new era in physics. the physicists revealed their latest results at a seminar at the european center for nuclear research (cern) in geneva, which was shared with the world with a live webcast and the evo (enabling virtual organizations) system developed at caltech. the discovery itself is based on the analysis of an unprecedented amount of data that was collected by the two main detectors at the lhc-the compact muon solenoid (cms) and a toroidal lhc apparatus (atlas). the data was collected with the lhc running at 7 teraelectron volts (tev, a unit of energy) in 2011 and 8 tev in 2012. the caltech team is part of the cms collaboration. using the cms detector, the physicists identified signals that point to a new particle with a mass of 125 gigaelectron volts (gev, a unit of mass; in comparison, the mass of a proton is about 1 gev). the team running the atlas detector, which searches for the higgs using a different method, reported similar results. "this is an incredible, exciting moment," says spiropulu. "even these early results give us important hints as to how mass in the universe came to be. together with hundreds of our colleagues caltech scientists have worked for decades to reach this point: building multiple generations of experiments; designing and building detectors to precisely measure photons, electrons, and muons, which are keys to the discovery; and inventing worldwide systems that empower thousands of physicists throughout the world to collaborate day and night, share and analyze the data, and develop the new techniques leading to this great result." to search for the higgs, physicists have had to comb through the remains of trillions of particle collisions produced by the lhc, which accelerates protons around a ring almost five miles wide to nearly the speed of light. as the protons careen toward each other, a small fraction of them collide, creating other particles such as the higgs. it is estimated that it takes one billion collisions to make just one higgs boson. the higgs is fleeting, however, and quickly decays into lighter particles, which are the traces that allow the higgs to be detected and analyzed. the higgs is predicted to decay in several different ways, or channels, each resulting in different particles. cms focuses mainly on the decay channels that result in two photons or two other particles called z bosons. it was by measuring and analyzing these and other decay particles that the physicists were able to discover the potential higgs. when all the decays are taken into account in combination, the scientists announced, the data for a signal corresponding to a standard model higgs boson have a statistical significance of five sigmas. this means the signal is highly unlikely to be the result of a statistical fluke caused by some rare, background fluctuation. only when data are significant to five sigmas are physicists confident enough to declare a discovery. last december, evidence seen in the data from cms generated plenty of excitement as a result of an excess of events-a slight surplus in particle collision events over what would have been expected if the higgs does not exist-with a statistical significance of just three sigmas. the higgs boson is the last remaining fundamental particle predicted by the standard model yet to be detected, and hopes of detecting it was one of the chief reasons for building the lhc. the lhc accelerator, along with the cms and atlas experiments, are arguably the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. despite its many successes, the standard model is incomplete-it does not incorporate gravity or dark matter, for example. one of the goals of physicists, then, is to develop more complete theories that better explain the composition of the universe and what happened during the first moments after the big bang. discovering the higgs boson-or a particle like it-is essential for developing these new theories. the measurements of the new particle, the physicists say, are so far consistent-within statistical uncertainty-with the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. still, they need more data to know for sure whether it is the predicted higgs or something stranger, a higgs lookalike-a prospect that many theorists have long been anticipating.

T	scientists discover subatomic particle at the center of everything | tbo.com
C	a half-century scientific quest culminated wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson, or god particle, it is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research. he made the statement after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in geneva. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of the particle in 1964, teared up. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime," higgs said. as late as tuesday, two teams of scientists pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs. * * * * * the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found. the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist. "this is why (nobel prize-winning physicist) leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. mass is not the same as weight, though the two concepts are easily confused. an object has mass even in outer space. mass is an object's resistance to being shoved around - its inertia. ordinary matter that makes up the bulk of stars, planets and human beings is relatively massive. the most massive particles move like someone trying to walk through neck-high water. this notion of a field that gives particles mass has been essential to understanding the way the universe is put together. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. * * * * * the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of criss-crossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. two independent teams, working on two separate particle detectors, arrived at similar results in a kind of cross-check. the two teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not allowed to share their results with each other before the seminar at cern on wednesday. to find this tiny particle, scientists built the large hadron collider, a 17-mile ring under the french-swiss border. at two points along the ring, they installed cathedral-size detectors that capture traces of high-energy collisions of protons. inside this subatomic wreckage, both detectors saw evidence for a subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 giga-electron volts, or about 125 times the mass of a proton. cern announced last december that it was homing in on the higgs, but cautioned that it needed a new batch of high-energy collisions to gain confidence that scientists were seeing something real, not a random bump in data.

T	a closer look at the higgs boson | highlands today
C	berlin -- scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. * * * * * school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. * * * * * the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. * * * * * cern's atom smasher , the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. * * * * * the practical results from the search weren't direct, but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. * * * * * "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so, they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature.

"it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." physical therapy bay area physical therapy

T	blog: 'i think we have it'
C	with those words, one of the most momentous scientific discoveries in history may have been announced to the world. large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. the uncertainty and skepticism is what true science is all about. contrast the scientists at hadron with the climate change hysterics who speak with such dead certainty about their theory despite the fact that their models have proven to be unreliable an indicator of what is to come.

T	physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson
C	the compact muon solenoid (cms) detector at the large hadron collider (lhc). [credit: cern] pasadena, ca-(enewspf)- physicists at the large hadron collider (lhc) in geneva, switzerland, have discovered a new particle that may be the long-sought higgs boson, the fundamental particle that is thought to endow elementary particles with mass. "this is a momentous time in the history of particle physics and in scientific exploration-the implications are profound," says harvey newman, professor of physics at the california institute of technology (caltech). "this is experimental science at its best." the international team of scientists and engineers-which includes a large contingent from caltech, led by newman and maria spiropulu, professor of physics-says it needs more data to determine for certain if the particle they've discovered is indeed the higgs boson predicted by the standard model, the theory that describes how all particles interact. the results so far, however, show that it has many of the properties expected for such a particle. "one of the most exciting aspects of this observation is that the road remains open for a vast range of 'lookalike' alternatives, where any deviation from the standard model would point the way to the existence of other new particles or forces of nature," newman says. regardless of the exact identity of the new particle, cern's scientists say, the highly anticipated discovery heralds a new era in physics. the physicists revealed their latest results at a seminar at the european center for nuclear research (cern) in geneva, which was shared with the world with a live webcast and the evo (enabling virtual organizations) system developed at caltech. the discovery itself is based on the analysis of an unprecedented amount of data that was collected by the two main detectors at the lhc-the compact muon solenoid (cms) and a toroidal lhc apparatus (atlas). the data was collected with the lhc running at 7 teraelectron volts (tev, a unit of energy) in 2011 and 8 tev in 2012. the caltech team is part of the cms collaboration. using the cms detector, the physicists identified signals that point to a new particle with a mass of 125 gigaelectron volts (gev, a unit of mass; in comparison, the mass of a proton is about 1 gev). the team running the atlas detector, which searches for the higgs using a different method, reported similar results. "this is an incredible, exciting moment," says spiropulu. "even these early results give us important hints as to how mass in the universe came to be. together with hundreds of our colleagues caltech scientists have worked for decades to reach this point: building multiple generations of experiments; designing and building detectors to precisely measure photons, electrons, and muons, which are keys to the discovery; and inventing worldwide systems that empower thousands of physicists throughout the world to collaborate day and night, share and analyze the data, and develop the new techniques leading to this great result." to search for the higgs, physicists have had to comb through the remains of trillions of particle collisions produced by the lhc, which accelerates protons around a ring almost five miles wide to nearly the speed of light. as the protons careen toward each other, a small fraction of them collide, creating other particles such as the higgs. it is estimated that it takes one billion collisions to make just one higgs boson. the higgs is fleeting, however, and quickly decays into lighter particles, which are the traces that allow the higgs to be detected and analyzed. the higgs is predicted to decay in several different ways, or channels, each resulting in different particles. cms focuses mainly on the decay channels that result in two photons or two other particles called z bosons. it was by measuring and analyzing these and other decay particles that the physicists were able to discover the potential higgs. when all the decays are taken into account in combination, the scientists announced, the data for a signal corresponding to a standard model higgs boson have a statistical significance of five sigmas. this means the signal is highly unlikely to be the result of a statistical fluke caused by some rare, background fluctuation. only when data are significant to five sigmas are physicists confident enough to declare a discovery. last december, evidence seen in the data from cms generated plenty of excitement as a result of an excess of events-a slight surplus in particle collision events over what would have been expected if the higgs does not exist-with a statistical significance of just three sigmas. the higgs boson is the last remaining fundamental particle predicted by the standard model yet to be detected, and hopes of detecting it was one of the chief reasons for building the lhc. the lhc accelerator, along with the cms and atlas experiments, are arguably the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. despite its many successes, the standard model is incomplete-it does not incorporate gravity or dark matter, for example. one of the goals of physicists, then, is to develop more complete theories that better explain the composition of the universe and what happened during the first moments after the big bang. discovering the higgs boson-or a particle like it-is essential for developing these new theories. the measurements of the new particle, the physicists say, are so far consistent-within statistical uncertainty-with the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. still, they need more data to know for sure whether it is the predicted higgs or something stranger, a higgs lookalike-a prospect that many theorists have long been anticipating. by the end of 2012, the caltech researchers say, the cms collaboration expects to more than double its current total amount of data. with more data and analysis, the scientists might then be able to confirm whether the particle they announced tonight is indeed the higgs-and whether it is the standard model higgs or a more exotic version. pbs documentary 'the city dark' explores problems of light pollution cern experiments observe particle consistent with long-sought higgs boson

T	grand discovery made in long-sought particle, higgs boson -- or the 'god particle' - pittsburgh post-gazette
C	alvarez's two-run single in 7th seals win, pirates hit first place in nl pittsburgh cyclist still has drive after hit-and-run that nearly claimed his life pittsburgh's humane officers are frustrated by repeat cases of animal neglect parents organize conference on child's rare disease: remi's glut1 disease the westmoreland arts & heritage festival offers everything from mysterians to creepshows to comics movie review: 'part of me' captures the sugary pop and backstage tears on katy perry's california dreams tour grand discovery made in long-sought particle, higgs boson -- or the 'god particle' washington -- a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle -- one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson -- or the "god particle," to the chagrin of scientists -- the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," said mr. heuer. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," said mr. heuer. moments later, mr. higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution -- a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" -- scientists around the world celebrated the moment. a video feed from melbourne, australia, where an international physics conference is set to begin, showed an auditorium packed with cheering scientists. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at fermilab, long-time home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, some 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," said mr. lincoln. "people were riveted. discovery is what scientists live for." at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared a bottle of champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts, one of the more than 6,000 scientists who contributed to the discovery. "i'm still astonished that at 3 a.m. on the fourth of july you can gather" so many people excited about the arcane field of subatomic physics, mr. tuts said. high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and professors all shared the bubbly after the discovery became clear. "we toasted this," said mr. tuts. "it was great fun to see the culmination of years and years of work." with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 -- set two years ago to line up with the conference in melbourne -- cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the huge large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation wednesday morning. the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found -- and the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field the permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," said mr. lykken. "this is why nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe -- protons, neutrons, electrons and so on -- interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more massive objects get tangled up in the field -- and hence, slowed down as they move -- more than less massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of criss-crossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. to report inappropriate comments, abuse and/or repeat offenders, please send an email to

T	physicists celebrate evidence of higgs boson -- the 'god particle' | theledger.com
C	geneva | scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and could crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who thought it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson, itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was thought to be there, too. and now that scientists actually have seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular, 17-mile-long underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle, itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson soon would be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for nonscientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer also have resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ? now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. copyright 2012 theledger.com - all rights reserved. restricted use only.

T	make a wish!: god particle: the real quest begins now
C	confirmation of the higgs boson, or something very like it, would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who've believed in the boson without ever seeing it. according to the standard model of physics, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, or something like it, physicists say all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said they'd study the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is dark matter that provides gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner of new york university says. one intriguing candidate for the next theory they have been on the watch for is called supersymmetry, "susy" for short, which would come with a new laundry list of particles to be discovered, one of which might be the source of dark matter. in supersymmetry there are at least two higgs bosons. scientists say: "the whole world thinks there is one higgs, but there could be many of them." wednesday's announcement is also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which collides protons and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half power. physicists had been holding their breaths and perhaps icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti and the other cms, led by joe incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the new results capped three weeks of feverish speculation as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a break-neck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. in the end, the cern council decided that the historic announcement should come from the lab's own turf first. up until last weekend, physicists from inside were reporting that they did not know what the outcome would be, though many were having fun with the speculation. "higgsrumors" became one of the most popular hashtags on twitter. the particle acquired its own iphone app, a game called "agent higgs." expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory, including peter higgs, had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke. like omar sharif materializing out of a distant sandstorm into a man on horseback in the movie "lawrence of arabia," what was once a hint of a signal has grown over the last year, until it practically jumps off the chart, according to those who have seen it. ?2011 the new york times news service -toi

"as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," said mr. heuer. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," said mr. heuer. moments later, mr. higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution -- a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" -- scientists around the world celebrated the moment. a video feed from melbourne, australia, where an international physics conference is set to begin, showed an auditorium packed with cheering scientists. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at fermilab, long-time home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, some 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," said mr. lincoln. "people were riveted. discovery is what scientists live for." at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared a bottle of champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts, one of the more than 6,000 scientists who contributed to the discovery. "i'm still astonished that at 3 a.m. on the fourth of july you can gather" so many people excited about the arcane field of subatomic physics, mr. tuts said. high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and professors all shared the bubbly after the discovery became clear. "we toasted this," said mr. tuts. "it was great fun to see the culmination of years and years of work." with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 -- set two years ago to line up with the conference in melbourne -- cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the huge large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation wednesday morning. the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found -- and the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field the permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," said mr. lykken. "this is why nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe -- protons, neutrons, electrons and so on -- interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more massive objects get tangled up in the field -- and hence, slowed down as they move -- more than less massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of criss-crossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. to report inappropriate comments, abuse and/or repeat offenders, please send an email to

T	a closer look at the higgs boson
C	berlin - scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a 'sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as 'super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost about $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next? "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. copyright 2012 stltoday.com. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. st. louis coupons: get fantastic deals - up to 80% off - sent to your e-mail. sign up today!

C	geneva, switzerland - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. without the higgs field, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. there were similar celebratory scenes in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by british physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle was a boson, but he stopped just shy of saying that it was the higgs itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular, 17-mile underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter, and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the two teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics was still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." higgs, 83, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's reported discovery appeared to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for nonscientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing. because your contributions are currently under review, no comments can be made at this time. philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations. please treat other participants with respect and in a way that you would want to be treated. you are responsible for what you say. and please, stay on topic. if you see an objectionable post, please report it to us using the "report abuse" button. about your comments: these comments are monitored by philly.com staff. we reserve the right at all times to remove any information or materials that are unlawful, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, pornographic, profane, indecent or otherwise objectionable. personal attacks, especially on other participants, are not permitted. we reserve the right to permanently block any user who violates these terms and conditions. according to our terms of service, you are not yet of legal age to be able to contribute to this site. thank you for registering! please note that your registration will not be considered fully complete until you confirm by following the link we have provided in a confirmation email that was just sent to voter id law may affect more pennsylvanians than previously estimated new pennsylvania law allows expert testimony on victims' response in sex-assault cases fourth of july grilling tip: don't swallow the wire brush.

T	blog: 'i think we have it'
C	with those words, one of the most momentous scientific discoveries in history may have been announced to the world. large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a potential key to an understanding of why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, said in an interview from his office outside geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century, or whether it is an impostor, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered. the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle, but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. the uncertainty and skepticism is what true science is all about. contrast the scientists at hadron with the climate change hysterics who speak with such dead certainty about their theory despite the fact that their models have proven to be unreliable an indicator of what is to come.

T	the namibian: eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle
C	05.07.2012 eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle by: john heilprin geneva - to cheers and standing ovations from scientists, the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle yesterday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the 'god particle' - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european centre for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorise occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said yesterday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2 100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3 000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say. but he told the audience that the discovery appears to be so close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometre underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase 'god particle' was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed.

T	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle scientists at the cern research centre in switzerland reveal they have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson link to this video there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simple proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: "this is sensational news and quite brilliant science. without doubt, cern has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level. i have waited over 20 years for this moment and am thrilled by the news. the excitement will continue now, as we all try to figure out just how this thing behaves." john ellis, who has worked at cern since the 1970s, said the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. "now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? "the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter." "we're not certain, but i'd be willing to bet the house this turns out to be some sort of higgs particle," said joe incandela, spokesperson for the cms collaboration. higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle follow all the top science stories of the day on twitter quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

C	god particle found- a new dawn of science scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the 'god particle' because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks an d other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a 'sticky' field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as 'super-symmetry' where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost?cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next 'this is just the beginning,' says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 per cent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. prof. john kurakar

T	a x e s m u n d i: physics | the boson "god particle"
C	on the fourth of july particle physics, a quite esoteric science for the majority, made to the headlines: after five decades of theories and experiments , the physicists at cern , the european organization for nuclear research announced that they have almost certainly detected a boson. a boson is one of two elementary particles that according to quantum theory makes up the universe; the other particles are fermions, that is protons and electrons. cern declared that "our understanding of the universe is about to change" and the atlas and cms experiments at cern today presented their latest results in the search for the long-sought higgs boson. both experiments see strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (gev). the experiments found hints of the new particle by analysing trillions of proton-proton collisions from the large hadron collider (lhc) in 2011 and 2012. the standard model of particle physics predicts that a higgs boson would decay into different particles - which the lhc experiments then detect. the higgs boson has been nicknamed the "god particle" from the popular science book "the god particle: if the universe is the answer, what is the question?" by the nobel prize winner physicist leonard lederman. he wrote that the higgs boson is "so central to the state of physics today, so crucial to our final understanding of the structure of matter, yet so elusive" a proton-proton collision event in the cms experiment producing two high-energy photons (red towers). this is what we would expect to see from the decay of a higgs boson but it is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. ? cern 2012

C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times scientists at the fermilab in batavia, ill., on wednesday watched the presentation about the discovery of the higgs boson, which was shown from geneva. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

C	rolf heuer, director general of cern (european organization for nuclear research), answers a journalist's question about the scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin near geneva, switzerland, wednesday, july 4, 2012. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. (ap photo/keystone/martial trezzini) geneva (ap) - to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. new backcourt leads lathrup over dragons dominatrix claims in radio interview bob bashara and joe gentz had affair former farmington hills resident pens book on infertility, frustrations bristol palin and a&e sued over series dear abby july 1: southern hospitality lacking in grad's northern social circles commerce township pilot killed in plane crash had ties to racing industry stephen frye has covered the police beat and courts for the oakland press and now serves as online editor for www.theoaklandpress.com. informs on and discusses current matters of legal interest to readers of the oakland press and to consumers of legal services in the community. cindy haskin-popp will help you make physical activity a part of everyday life. the health benefits of regular exercise and overall daily physical activity will be discussed. karen will share a variety of information, including training tips, behavior, breed and health information, as well as heart-warming and comedic stories about her own dog and others. caren gittleman likes talking cats. she'll discuss everything about them. share your stories and ask her questions about your favorite feline. roger beukema shares news from lansing that impacts sportsmen (this means ladies as well) and talks about things he finds when he goes overseas to visit his children, and adding your comments into the mix. ? copyright 2012 the oakland press

T	scientists say higgs boson is at the center of everything - the denver post
C	geneva - a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson - or the "god particle," to the chagrin of scientists - the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in british physicist peter higgs, right, congratulates fabiola gianotti, atlas experiment spokesperson, after her results presentation during a seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson. ( denis balibouse, the associated press ) geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," heuer said. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," heuer said. moments later, higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution - a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" - scientists around the world celebrated the moment. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared a bottle of champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts, one of the more than 6,000 scientists who contributed to the discovery. "i'm still astonished that at 3 a.m. on the fourth of july you can gather" so many people excited about the arcane field of subatomic physics, tuts said. with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 - set two years ago to line up with the conference in melbourne - cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the huge large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation wednesday. the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found. the higgs was the last holdout - and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," lykken said. "this is why [nobel prize-winning physicist] leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more massive objects get tangled up in the field - and hence, slowed down as they move - more than less massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. two independent teams, working on two separate particle detectors, arrived at similar results - a kind of cross-check. the two teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not to share their results with each other before the seminar at cern on wednesday. the idea of the higgs, or something like it, has been around since 1964, when it was first hypothesized by peter higgs. the standard model of physics had a hole in it - one that needed to be filled by a particle that imbues everything with mass. it became known as the higgs boson - and its discovery, many scientists say, will now surely garner a nobel prize. this notion of a field that gives particles mass has been essential to understanding the way the universe is put together. columbia university physicist brian greene, speaking prior to the announcement, said, "everything i've ever done, directly or indirectly, has something to do with a higgs-like field." copyright 2012 the denver post. all rights reserved.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle | world news | the guardian
C	john heilprin associated press= geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. syria crisis: turkey finds bodies of downed pilots - wednesday 4 july 2012 in the moment by tom jenkins ?20.00

T	high-fives in physics for ?higgs? find
C	an undated handout graphic distributed on july 4, by the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in geneva shows a representation of traces of a proton- proton collision measured in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experiment in the search for the higgs boson. (afp) milestone for mankind in 'mass on matter' geneva, july 4, (agencies): after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists said wednesday they had found a sub-atomic particle that may be the elusive higgs boson, believed to confer mass on matter. rousing cheers and a standing ovation erupted at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented astonishing new data in their search for the mysterious particle. many hailed it as a moment in history, and white-haired veterans of the quest shed tears of joy. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. he and others cautioned, though, that further work was needed to identify what exactly had been found. "as a layman i would say we have it, but as a scientist i have to say, 'what do we have?'" heuer told a press conference. "we have discovered a boson, and now we have to determine what kind of boson it is." finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. peter higgs, the shy, soft-spoken briton who in 1964 published the conceptual groundwork for the particle and whose name became associated with it, expressed delight. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," the 83-year-old said in a statement. higgs sat next to belgian physicist francois englert, 79, who separately contributed to the theory. "i just want to say that my thoughts go to robert brout," said englert, his eyes moisted with tears, as he lauded a fellow pioneer who died in 2011. the standar model is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinised for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." at a particle-physics conference in melbourne, australia, a participant said there was a "jaw-dropping" moment when the scientists reacted to the announcement. scientists began to pore over what the find could mean. "this is an important result and should earn peter higgs the nobel prize, but it is a pity in a way, because the great advances in physics have come from experiments that gave results we didn't expect," said cosmologist stephen hawking in an interview with the bbc. "for this reason i had a bet with gordon kane of michigan university that the higgs particle wouldn't be found. it seems i have just lost $100." cern physicist yves sirois said that the result did seem to back the standard model but further surprises could be in store. "it may be the higgs boson, but it may also be something far bigger, which opens the door towards a new theory that goes beyond the standard model." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a'' higgs - that was the question wednesday.

T	high-fives in physics for ?higgs? find
C	an undated handout graphic distributed on july 4, by the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in geneva shows a representation of traces of a proton- proton collision measured in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experiment in the search for the higgs boson. (afp) milestone for mankind in 'mass on matter' geneva, july 4, (agencies): after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists said wednesday they had found a sub-atomic particle that may be the elusive higgs boson, believed to confer mass on matter. rousing cheers and a standing ovation erupted at the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented astonishing new data in their search for the mysterious particle. many hailed it as a moment in history, and white-haired veterans of the quest shed tears of joy. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. he and others cautioned, though, that further work was needed to identify what exactly had been found. "as a layman i would say we have it, but as a scientist i have to say, 'what do we have?'" heuer told a press conference. "we have discovered a boson, and now we have to determine what kind of boson it is." finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. peter higgs, the shy, soft-spoken briton who in 1964 published the conceptual groundwork for the particle and whose name became associated with it, expressed delight. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," the 83-year-old said in a statement. higgs sat next to belgian physicist francois englert, 79, who separately contributed to the theory.

C	geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of ``the missing cornerstone of physics'' wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or ``god particle,'' which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself; an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it,'' he told the elated crowd. ``we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson.'' the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight.

T	physicists claim 'god particle' discovery | hanford news | tri-city herald
C	by john heilprin, associated press geneva (ap) -- scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself -- an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle -- a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries."

T	"it has brought the world closer" - welsh scientist hails higgs find - need to read - news - walesonline
C	dr lyn evans, the aberdare-born scientist who has led the large hadron collider project the rugby-loving welsh scientist who oversaw the making of the ?2.6bn "big bang machine" yesterday spoke of his joy after it apparently hunted down the elusive higgs boson particle. aberdare-born dr lyn evans said the achievement by scientists using the futuristic large hadron collider (lhc), a 17-mile circular particle accelerator buried beneath the franco-swiss border, was a major breakthrough. scientists at cern, the european organisation for nuclear research, announced yesterday the lhc had found a new particle "consistent" with the description of the higgs boson, the so-called "god particle". the discovery was described as "momentous" and "a milestone". but the results are preliminary and more work is needed before the scientists can be sure about what they have captured. swansea university physics graduate dr evans, known as "evans the atom", was project leader of the lhc experiment in cern from its outset. he said: "i spent 16 years of my life ensuring this machine was up and running. to think they have finally found what could be what they have been looking for is fantastic, a real scientific breakthrough. "people criticised the cost of the lhc but governments all over the world contributed. "it not only gives us a much clearer understanding of how the world works, it has brought the world closer together. "we have palestinian scientists, jewish scientists, russians, americans, british, you name it, all working together." the lhc at cern is a 17-mile ring of helium refrigerated magnets, literally the coolest thing on earth. it shoots particles at each other at near light speeds to recreate conditions trillionths of seconds after the "big bang" when scientists believe the universe started. it was first switched on by 67-year-old dr evans as the world watched in awe on tv in 2008. dr evans , who grew up in a council house in cwmbach and who lives with his wife linda at their family home on the outskirts of geneva, retired as lhc project director in 2010 after it had overcome early problems. read more: walesonline's idiot's guide to the higgs boson, "the god particle". the couple have a 40-year-old son ian and 38-year-old daughter sian. dr evans was famously accused of being "a destroyer of worlds" before the lhc project began. the switch on, counted down in dr evans' distinctive welsh voice, held worldwide fascination after fears the awesome power unleashed by atoms smashing together so fast could create a black hole sucking in the earth. cern strongly denied the claims and an american court threw out a lawsuit by two citizens in hawaii. however, before the lhc could reach full speed it broke down. it was re-started only to be broken again - before the near light speed collisions could occur - when a bird dropped part of a baguette into a cooling unit. finding the higgs plugs a gaping hole in the standard model, the theory that describes all the particles, forces and interactions that make up the universe. if the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the so-called "standard model" and going back to the drawing board. last december, lhc scientists revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the long sought after particle. since the initial excitement the scientists sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the chances of being wrong. yesterday's news was broken at a packed seminar at the geneva headquarters of cern, the european organisation for nuclear research. professor peter higgs, 83, the unassuming, retired british physicist from edinburgh university after whom the particle was named, was present. he dreamed up the concept of the higgs mechanism to explain mass while walking in the cairngorms in 1964. he wiped a tear from his eye as the announcement of the discovery was made. "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged," he said. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." prof higgs could now be eligible for a nobel prize. the lhc, the largest scientific instrument ever built, lies in an underground tunnel that straddles the franco-swiss border near geneva. protons, the "hearts" of atoms, are fired around the ring in opposite directions at almost the speed of light. when they smash together, huge amounts of energy are converted into mass and new particles created which then decay into lighter particles. higgs bosons emerge from the maelstrom but only very fleetingly, for less than a trillionth of a second, before decaying. by tracing the decay patterns, the scientists were able to find the "fingerprint" of the higgs. yesterday, professor graham shore, head of swansea university's department of physics said: "this is fantastic news. "the evidence for the existence of the higgs boson presented at cern is even stronger than i think any of us had been expecting even a couple of weeks ago. "for many of us, this is a discovery that we have been hoping for through most of our careers. "the higgs boson was the key missing link in our theories of the structure of matter at the most fundamental level. "its discovery opens the way to a new era in particle physics and we can now confidently anticipate many new discoveries at the lhc. "while this announcement provides conclusive evidence that the higgs boson exists, the next step at cern will be to examine its properties in detail. the data is intriguing, with some hints of a richer structure than in the simplest standard model. "at swansea, we have been exploring such theories and we are eagerly anticipating further results from cern later in the year. "next week, swansea is hosting a major international conference with more than 100 particle physicists from around the world. "peter higgs, who is an honorary fellow of the university, is expected to attend. "on a personal note, i am delighted by this discovery. i have known peter ever since he taught me as an undergraduate in edinburgh in the early 1970s and his theory of the 'higgs boson' was one of the first things i learned about in the world of particle physics. walesonline, the best source for welsh news, sport, business and lifestyle and entertainment. powered by the western mail, south wales echo, wales on sunday and celtic weekly newspapers. produced by media wales ltd.

T	scientists say higgs boson is at the center of everything - the denver post
C	geneva - a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson - or the "god particle," to the chagrin of scientists - the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in british physicist peter higgs, right, congratulates fabiola gianotti, atlas experiment spokesperson, after her results presentation during a seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson. ( denis balibouse, the associated press ) geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," heuer said. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," heuer said. moments later, higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution - a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" - scientists around the world celebrated the moment. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared a bottle of champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts, one of the more than 6,000 scientists who contributed to the discovery. "i'm still astonished that at 3 a.m. on the fourth of july you can gather" so many people excited about the arcane field of subatomic physics, tuts said. with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 - set two years ago to line up with the conference in melbourne - cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the huge large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation wednesday. the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found. the higgs was the last holdout - and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," lykken said. "this is why [nobel prize-winning physicist] leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more massive objects get tangled up in the field - and hence, slowed down as they move - more than less massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. two independent teams, working on two separate particle detectors, arrived at similar results - a kind of cross-check. the two teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not to share their results with each other before the seminar at cern on wednesday. the idea of the higgs, or something like it, has been around since 1964, when it was first hypothesized by peter higgs. the standard model of physics had a hole in it - one that needed to be filled by a particle that imbues everything with mass. it became known as the higgs boson - and its discovery, many scientists say, will now surely garner a nobel prize. this notion of a field that gives particles mass has been essential to understanding the way the universe is put together. columbia university physicist brian greene, speaking prior to the announcement, said, "everything i've ever done, directly or indirectly, has something to do with a higgs-like field." higgs boson what it is: a theorized subatomic particle that holds together the electrons, protons and neutrons that make up atoms. what it means: the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. that it apparently exists means scientists have been on the right track with their theories and opens the possibility to potential new discoveries. what's next: scientists probe the new particle until they understand how it works. copyright 2012 the denver post. all rights reserved. print email font resize return to top

T	the higgs boson - found at last ! | use celsias.com - reduce global ?celsius
C	it looks like they have found it - the elusive higgs boson particle , aka the god particle. awesome! large hadron collider in geneva may finally have tracked down the elusive higgs boson. results announced today at "if the higgs has been finally identified, this will be the biggest discovery in particle physics for forty years," said dr joel goldstein , leader of the cms activityin bristol's school of physics. the higgs boson is the essential connection between the mathematical theory of the universe, and the everyday world. without it, the fundamental particles which make up atoms would be massless, completely at odds with what we observe. at a deeper level, the higgs allows two of the four forces of nature to be treated as one simpler phenomenon, and completes the 'standard model' of particle physics first proposed in the 1970s. the search for the higgs requires the careful study of thousands of trillions of particle collisions at incredibly high energies. the lhc accelerates beams of protons around a 27km ring on the swiss-french border. on collision, the protons' energy is converted to new particles, which are detected by a series of huge and complex experiments. from around a billion collisions per second, a higgs boson is expected to be produced around once per minute - but only a fraction of these can be detected. the identification of the new particle is the first step in the lhc research programme, and opens the door to a huge range of possibilities. physicists will now accumulate much more data in order to carefully measure the properties of the particle - only then can they positively identify it. many physicists believe that the simplest version of higgs' theory must be modified by a new phenomenon called supersymmetry. this would also provide clues as to the origin of the mysterious 'dark matter' which occupies the galaxy alongside stars and planets, and would also point the way towards deeper and simpler theories of space and time. "these new results are a huge achievement, but really represent the first step on a long road of discovery," said dr dave newbold , head of the bristol particle physics group. "the really exciting physics is all ahead of us, and it may not turn out to be what we expect." the lhc will shut down in 2013 for two years, allowing the equipment which steers and controls the proton beams to be upgraded. from 2015, the accelerator will operate with twice its current energy and three times the number of collisions, putting new discoveries within reach. work on cms is carried out in bristol alongside the study of antimatter at the cern lhcb experiment, and preparations for future facilities that will allow the higgs to be 'mass-produced' and studied in detail. the higgs boson is a type of elementary, sub-atomic particle that is widely believed to play a key role in shaping the way the universe functions. confirming its existence is one of the main objectives of the large hadron collider (lhc), which is located at cern (the european organization for nuclear research) in switzerland. physicists have developed a theory called 'the standard model' to explain how the various types of elementary particle that make up the visible universe interact. with the exception of neutrino physics, results from other particle physics experiments match the standard model extremely well - but only if one missing piece, the higgs boson, is assumed to exist. based on the particles discovered to date, the standard model could not otherwise explain why some particles have mass (e.g. electrons), while others don't (e.g. photons which make up light). theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson is the key. so most physicists conclude that another elementary particle must exist - the higgs boson - and that this gives other particles their mass. in terms of our understanding of matter and the basic forces shaping the universe, this is a critical issue: without mass, there would be no matter. how does the discovery of the higgs boson compare to earlier scientific discoveries? the search for the higgs boson mirrors the discovery of the electron. the concept of the electron was first proposed in 1838 to explain the chemical properties of the atom but its presence was not confirmed by british physicist and nobel prize winner jj thompson until 1897. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. manipulating or harnessing phenomena such as electricity, magnetism and thermal conductivity rely on our understanding of the electron - applications include cathode ray tubes (television), radiotherapy treatments for cancer patients, lasers (cds, energy, manufacturing etc), microscopes, and, of course, particle accelerators like the lhc. spintronics, the technique of manipulating electron 'spin', has the potential to bring us faster computers, increased data storage and more efficient photovoltaic cells. our search for knowledge about our universe continues and it is impossible to determine where it will lead in terms of fundamental knowledge or applications. for example, we do not know why photons, the particles that make up light, have no mass. jj thompson could not have predicted where his discovery of the electron would lead, and similarly we do not know where the discovery of the higgs boson could lead. each advance opens up a new frontier of science. it's believed that higgs bosons are responsible for determining how much mass other types of elementary particle have. the theory goes as follows: countless numbers of higgs bosons make up an energy field ('the higgs field') that extends throughout the universe. when other types of elementary particle move through the higgs field, some do so very easily (like an arrow flying through the air); this results in them having little mass and, in some cases, no mass at all. but other, less 'streamlined' types of elementary particle don't move through the higgs field so easily and this results in them having a relatively high mass. sub-atomic particles are divided into two categories: bosons and fermions. generally speaking, bosons are force-carrying particles while fermions are associated with matter. the higgs boson is named after professor peter higgs, a theoretical physicist at the university of edinburgh. professor higgs was one of a number of physicists who predicted the existence of what's now known as the higgs boson, which has been dubbed 'the most sought-after particle in modern physics'. a number of other researchers, including thomas kibble of imperial independently or jointly proposed a similar mechanism, but it has become generally known as the higgs mechanism. you can not directly see a higgs boson. it's believed that, with the right experiment in place, a decaying higgs boson would leave behind a detectable 'footprint' in the form of a unique configuration of other particles. higgs bosons should (according to current theories) be created a few times in every trillion high energy particle collisions at the lhc. confirming the existence of the higgs boson will provide vital evidence that the standard model accurately accounts for how and why energy and matter behave as they do. it would act as a springboard to further research and an improved understanding of the universe. ultimately, it may have spin-off benefits in fields as diverse as medicine, computing, electronics and manufacturing. posted on july 5, 2012. listed in: pledge to do these related actions global warming alarmists often become strident and make absurd claims about the effects of global ... food for change: eat only plant-based foods for one whole month, 112?

T	god particle video leaked to website | newkerala.com, 47200
C	technology-news god particle video leaked to website london, july 4 : the cern physics laboratory near geneva appeared to have leaked crucial details of its hunt for the long-sought higgs boson - 'god particle' on tuesday when it accidentally posted a video announcing the discovery of a new particle on its website. senior scientists at cern are due to reveal the latest findings in their hunt for the famed particle at a much-anticipated press conference in geneva on wednesday, and had tried to keep the results under wraps, despite intense rumours that the laboratory had found the particle. but cern, which takes credit for inventing the world wide web, inadvertently released a video interview on its website dated 4 july 2012 in which spokesman joe incandela states the lab has "observed a new particle". a press officer at the laboratory blamed a technical glitch for the video going live. the interview was taken down shortly after. speaking on the video, incandela stopped short of claiming the particle was the higgs boson, saying more work was needed to be sure. "we have quite strong evidence that there's something there. it's properties are still going to take us a little bit of time," the guardian quoted him as saying. the details incandela revealed suggest it has the hallmarks of the higgs particle. "we can see that it decays into two photons, for example, which tells us it's a boson, it's a particle with integer spin, and we know its mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the proton. and this is very significant," incandela said. "this is the most massive such particle that exists, if we confirm all this, which i think we will. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks," he said. a spokesperson for cern said that the video went live on the internet due to a "technical fault". they added that the lab had recorded several videos in advance with spokespersons at the lab. two teams of physicists at cern are preparing to announce their latest efforts to discover the higgs boson at a press conference at the laboratory on wednesday morning.

T	scientists say higgs boson is at the center of everything - the denver post
C	geneva - a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson - or the "god particle," to the chagrin of scientists - the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in british physicist peter higgs, right, congratulates fabiola gianotti, atlas experiment spokesperson, after her results presentation during a seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson. ( denis balibouse, the associated press ) geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," heuer said. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," heuer said. moments later, higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution - a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" - scientists around the world celebrated the moment. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared a bottle of champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts, one of the more than 6,000 scientists who contributed to the discovery. "i'm still astonished that at 3 a.m. on the fourth of july you can gather" so many people excited about the arcane field of subatomic physics, tuts said. with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 - set two years ago to line up with the conference in melbourne - cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the huge large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation wednesday. the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found. the higgs was the last holdout - and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything.

T	'god particle' a gateway to new vision of universe - yahoo! news singapore
C	physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries including dark matter. the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) unveiled data from the large hadron collider on wednesday "consistent with the long-sought higgs boson", an elusive particle thought to help explain why matter has mass. it was hailed as a huge moment for science by physicists gathered in australia, where cern's findings were unveiled via videolink from geneva at a landmark conference attended by hundreds of the field's top experts. scientists went into a frenzy following the announcement, speculating that it could one day make light speed travel possible by "un-massing" objects or allow huge items to be launched into space by "switching off" the higgs. cern scientist albert de roeck likened it to the discovery of electricity, when he said humanity could never have imagined its future applications. "what's really important for the higgs is that it explains how the world could be the way that it is in the first millionth of a second in the big bang," de roeck told afp. "can we apply it to something? at this moment my imagination is too small to do that." physicist ray volkas said "almost everybody" was hoping that, rather than fitting the so-called standard model of physics -- a theory explaining how particles fit together in the universe -- the higgs bosun would prove to be "something a bit different". "if that was the case that would point to all sorts of new physics, physics that might have something to do with dark matter," he said, referring to the hypothetical matter some suggest makes up most of the mass in the universe. "it could be, for example, that the higgs particle acts as a bridge between ordinary matter, which makes up atoms, and dark matter, which we know is a very important component of the universe." "that would have really fantastic implications for understanding all of the matter in the universe, not just ordinary atoms," he added. de roeck said scrutinising the new particle and determining whether it supported something other than the standard model would be the next step for cern scientists. clarification could be expected by the beginning of 2013; definitive proof that it fitted the standard model could take until 2015 when the large hadron collider (lhc) had more power and could harvest more data. de roeck said he would find it a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the standard model higgs". instead, he was hoping it would be a "gateway or a portal to new physics, to new theories which are actually running nature" such as supersymmetry, which hypothesises that there are five different higgs particles governing mass. the search for higgs -- the logical next step of which de roeck said would be searching for, and eventually being able to produce, dark matter particles -- has already had huge benefits to medicine and technology. volkas said the internet was born at cern as a solution to high-volume data-sharing and other major spin-offs were likely to follow as physicists continued to "push the boundaries of pure science". "we just want to know how the world works, but in order to answer those questions you have to develop new technologies," he said. funding for particle physics is already under scrutiny in north america, where the lhc's predecessor, the tevatron, was closed late last year due to financial constraints. de roeck said there were similar problems in europe, where physicists will meet in september to discuss research priorities for the next 20 years and whether they need and can afford an accelerator after the lhc. "that is going to be a tough fight," he said. "despite this momentous moment we have now, it doesn't necessarily bring the funding which one would require." he urged governments and other key contributors to see fundamental science as a "must" rather than a luxury. not you? log out of facebook how to remove this experience

T	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle what happens inside the large hadron collider. scientists at cern, near geneva, have this morning announced the likely discovery of the higgs boson particle. photograph: cern 7.17am: good morning all. two teams of physicists at the cern laboratory near geneva are preparing today to announce their latest efforts to discover the participants take a rest early before the opening of the seminar. photograph: denis balibouse/afp/getty images the elusive "god particle" has become the most sought-after particle in modern science. its discovery would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space, and excitement in the scientific community is at fever pitch. peter higgs, the edinburgh university physicist who proposed the idea of the particle in 1964, is flying in to geneva, as are two other men who published similar theories at around the same time: fran?ois englert, professor emeritus at the free university of brussels (ulb) in belgium, and tom kibble, professor emeritus at imperial college london. there have been rumours, speculation, and, last night, even an apparent leak from the laboratory when a the guardian's ian sample has flown to geneva and i'll be live-blogging this potentially historic morning on this page. 7.38am: now, two video links for your viewing pleasure. and here is a video from the guardian's own resident boffin, science correspondent ian sample. heroically, he attempts to explain the higgs boson by means of a tray from our canteen and some coloured ping pong balls. british physicist peter higgs (right) arrives at the seminar. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 7.52am: clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. now, the anticipation mounts. 8.02am: and we're off. first up is joe incandela, the leader of the team using the cms detector to search for new particles. he'll be followed by fabiola gianotti from the other team using the atlas detector. he says the results are "very strong, very solid". 8.13am: as incandela speaks, the brilliant ian sample is live-tweeting from cern. july 4, 2012 and we're keeping our observations extremely serious in keeping with the potentially historic nature of the day. 8.21am: i'm not going to lie: this is a little above my gcse 8.24am: reuters has just posted a flash update that claims cern scientists have discovered a new sub-atomic particle that could be the higgs boson. scientists at the cern research centre have discovered a new subatomic particle that could be the elusive higgs boson, which is believed to be crucial in the formation of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of the uk's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." incandela: says when they combine the results for two decay channels they get five sigma for the 8.43am: more interpretative tweets courtesy of those who can interpret these results. and combined - 5 sigma. round of applause. that's a discovery of a higgs - like particle at cms. they thank lhc for the data! particle physics threshold for discovery. it roughly means that you're 99.9999% sure 8.48am: incandela has finished. there's warm applause. his summary: all channels combined, sensitivity is 4.9 sigma. all results are consistent. his reflection from incandela's presentation is: huge question ongoing: are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new? easiest way to make different channels mismatch is to add new particles to your theory that couple to the higgs, and enter as virtual particles that modify different decay rates. full employment for both experimentalists and theorists! 8.55am: up now is fabiola giannotti, leader of the 3,000-strong group that works on the collider's five-storey atlas detector. a little piece about her and her work at the lhc last year. the appointment put her in the top ranks of a profession dominated by men. she came to physics from an education steeped in ancient greek, philosophy and the history of art - she had also trained as a pianist at the milan conservatory. but she ultimately chose physics to answer the big question of why things are as they are. "physics is, unfortunately, often seen as a male subject; sterile and without charm or emotion," she told the cern magazine. "but this is not true, because physics is art, aesthetics, beauty and symmetry." brian cox. in simple language, cms have discovered a new boson, and it behaves like the standard model higgs 9.05am: ap's take on incandela's presentation. one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom smasher says it has found strong evidence of a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. joe incandela, leader of one of the teams, told scientists at the european center for nuclear research, or cern, that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, popularly referred to as the "god particle." 9.09am: the new scientist, reporting from the auditorium, says cern has pre-empted gianotti. and the results from atlas also look exciting. 9.14am: "both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev," confirms a press release from cern. this release as saying: we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage, but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication. the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks. and sergio bertolucci, research director of cern, says: it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data. the results presented today are labelled preliminary, the statement adds. they are based on data collected in 2011 and 2012, with the 2012 data still under analysis. publication of the analyses shown today is expected around the end of july. a more complete picture of today's observations will emerge later this year after the lhc provides the experiments with more data. the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe. are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient in the standard model of particle physics? or is it something more exotic? the standard model describes the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them. all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about 4% of the total. a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96% of the universe that remains obscure. positive identification of the new particle's characteristics will take considerable time and data. but whatever form the higgs particle takes, our knowledge of the fundamental structure of matter is about to take a major step forward. 9.21am: first reaction from peter higgs has just landed in my inbox. according to a statement sent by edinburgh university, the physicist says he is "astounded" at the speed with which the results have emerged and is preparing to celebrate. scientists at cern are to be congratulated on today's results, which are a great achievement for the large hadron collider and other experiments leading up to this. i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge. participants applaud after the presentation of the atlas experiments. photograph: denis balibouse/ap 9.23am: gianotti is still presenting atlas's results but the reaction is already pouring in. here's are the first few paragraphs from there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , home of the large hadron collider near geneva, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. 9.29am: "#cern" is trending worldwide. as is #higgs, and #godparticle (sorry), and atlas. no #higgsteria yet though, despite a valiant effort by social media types. 9.32am: today's discovery is "unbelievably exciting", according to harvard physicist lisa randall. i really didn't expect this. they got enough data and improved analysis to the point where we know about a new particle months before i expected (based on asking lots of people)! it is unbelievably exciting. , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern, had this evaluation for ian over in geneva: is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion. a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by cern. photograph: afp/getty images atlas - round of applause + cheers. 5 sigma discovery at 126.5 gev standard model expectation would be 4.6 sigma, so compatible with sm prediction july 4, 2012 "i'm not done yet; there's more to come!" she laughs. she has these guys in the palm of her hand. 9.41am: some physicists are being more certain about interpreting these results than others. for professor stefan s?ldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the university of manchester, "there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists". today we have witnessed a discovery which gives unique insight into our understanding of the universe and the origin of the masses of fundamental particles. there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists and we now have to understand its properties and whether it behaves exactly as predicted by theory. this discovery is the first milestone of the lhc physics programme and opens the door to many more exciting discoveries by the lhc experiments in the next decade. 9.44am: rolf heuer, director general of cern, offers this verdict: as a layman i would say: i think we have it. you agree? the audience claps. i think that's a yes. 9.46am: heuer flashes up on screen a slide that says cern have discovered "a particle consistent with the higgs boson- but which one?" so, while this is undoubtedly a milestone with "global implications", he says, it is also the beginning of a lot more research and investigation. but, he adds, "i think we can be very, very optimistic". 9.49am: peter higgs, who first proposed the idea of this boson in 1964 and is now 83, may have shed a tear or two there- a sight which seems to have got everyone else going too. #higgs is crying... it's a great day for physics. i am proud of being a physician :?) 9.58am: peter higgs has just been asked to say a few words. "for me it's a really incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," he said, giving his congratulations to everyone involved in what he described as a "tremendous achievement". 10.16am: earlier i pointed out that four of the 10 worldwide trends on twitter were higgs-related. i erred. there were five- but one of them was comic sans. turns out that, instead of remarking on the incredible achievements of the physicists at cern, some people would prefer to ridicule them for presenting their results in a funny font. cern need a design partner - comic sans for a serious presentation of breakthrough findings! really? cern's higgs presentation just added weight to the theory that comic sans is a terrible font. 10.18am: press conference time. more layman's terms please! first question goes straight to the point: "have you found the higgs boson or not?" heuer replies that, as he said earlier, in layman's terms, they have "got it". but as a scientist i say 'what do we have?' we have a boson. now we have to discover what kind of boson it is. 10.25am: for anyone who's just joined the fun, you can watch the live stream 10.28am: all the journalists are begging for layman's terms. rolf heuer of cern is trying all kinds of inventive allegories to explain the discovery. is it working? not entirely sure. 10.31am: were they surprised by how quickly they made this discovery? after all, points out one journalist, "supersymmetry" was what they were expected to hit upon first. yes, replies heuer. gianotti agrees, attributing the speed to the "impressive performance of the accelerator" and the experiments which have worked very well. incandela says that this discovery could actually help in the search for supersymmetry. in fact, the existence of a higgs-like boson actually is a very strong motivation for the existence of supersymmetry...we're going to try and hunt it down. 10.37am: ooo, we're into rumsfeldian territory here. a spokesman says they also want to go after the unknown unknowns. 10.38am: how did the leaders of atlas and cms feel upon completing this discovery? like "walking on air", says incandela. it was a magnificent moment to see the reaction of the community. gianotti praises the "dedication, the competence, the talent" of everyone in her team, atlas. 10.45am: john ellis of cern has emailed this evaluation to the guardian's ian sample. there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter. heuer has just had another valiant effort at explaining the science in terms a small child would understand. how close is what they've found to the higgs boson, asks a journalist? it's as if, he explains, you think you see your best friend- but is it your best friend or your best friend's twin? basically: more work is needed. he concluded: 10.54am: we're asking commenters to help us explain the higgs boson. my colleague hannah waldram has passed me on these interesting contributions: muscleguy: it's like there has been a figure in black in the ballet that the other dancers can see so dance around and with but we can't see. we see the shape of the ballet but cannot, until now see all the dancers. richardacre: it's like zoologists trying to determine if they've discovered a new species of butterfly by looking at a meadow through binoculars. from 16 miles away. our very own shiv malik has also put his scientist's hat on to try to explain one talking point is how reliable the results are. this is based on how certain physicists are about the data they have. the way this is normally measured is through standard deviation i.e. the 1-5 sigma that we've been hearing about. handy explainer graphically shows what deviation is on a usual distribution graph or a bell curve, where most results are based around the middle but there are also some extreme results at either end. something like plotting height amongst a big population of 35 year old males would give you a bell curve graph like this. tall and short at either end but most people are say, 5 ft 8". five sigma from the standard deviation therefore means many steps away from the norm. in terms of height it would be say, adults males who are either 2ft or 7ft tall i.e. very unusual. but now reverse engineer the exercise. imagine you are looking at 7ft people and you want to know how likely it is that this is a strange result from the middle or the norm. how would you work this out? how would you come up with a number to represent this? well, looking at the data, plotting the graph, you could say that 7ft adult males represent 5 sigma deviation from the norm, so you are pretty sure that this is an odd or unusual result and therefore worth being (statistically speaking) interested about. this is what those at cern have been saying today. 11.00am: as the journalists in geneva continue to beg the cern guys for replies they can understand, here at the guardian we are can you help us break it down into even simpler terms? if you're a scientist, a teacher or a physics fan with a knack for explaining big ideas and small particles, we're imploring you to help. ? how would you explain higgs boson to a 7-year-old? ? what analogy best explains what's happening at cern? ? can it be described in 200 words? 11.09am: a bold reuters journalist just asked them to provide their own metaphors for the higgs boson. alas. "the podium is metaphorless," replied heuer. british physicist peter higgs (right) speaks with belgium physicist francois englert. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 11.18am: ok, that's that. the press conference is over. throughout, peter higgs refused to make any comment other than to praise the achievement and to say he was making no further comment. he obviously didn't want to hog the limelight, which will only endear him further to his new legion of twitter fans. storify of twitter jokes about the higgs boson as collated by hannah waldram. sure there are plenty more to come, so tweet your best to @guardian on #higgsjokes. 11.34am: you can now read ian sample's excellent take on this morning's announcement at length here. and, for those of who still a little in the dark, check out 11.55am: my colleagues hannah and laura have been collating some of the lovely explanations coming in in response to our plea to explain the higgs boson in a way a 7-year-old child would understand. once upon a time in a far away land, there were two rival families: fermions and bosons. fermions were famous for their peculiar half spin dance. electrons, protons and quarks were all fermions. the bosons however were into full spinning though and despised half spin. photons and gluons were bosons. it was rumored that bosons had a long lost elder brother called higgs boson who had been missing for a long long time. one day a wise old man came to the land of the feuding families. he told them they should stop quaerlling over half spin and full spin, since they all used to be the same, and that they all used to be massless. the old man said that, in the beginning of time when the universe was created, everyone was born the same, but then they were immersed in a mysterious field called the higgs field making each of them different except for photons who remained the same. he said this mysterious field was made up of the higgs boson - the long lost boson brother. the families ofcourse refused to believe all this hogwash, and so the old man set about trying to prove his story and bring the higgs boson out of his hiding place. to do this he asked for help from the scientists at cern. the family feud is coming to an end, at last. 12.03pm: the science community seems agreed: this is a big moment. but many, like heuer, are cautioning that this could be just the beginning. dr roberto trotta, lecturer in cosmology at imperial college london, has this to say, according to the science media centre. this could be just the first step towards uncovering a completely new layer of reality - the higgs might lead to the discovery of supersymmetry: the notion that for every known particle there exist a super-particle with a much larger mass. and if supersymmetry is real, then we are on our way to finally crack the mystery of the dark matter in the universe. dark matter might be 'the last highlander' of all supersymmetric particles, the only surviving 'sparticle' from the big bang. and we might be on the verge of hunting it down at the lhc. professor john womersley, stfc chief executive, said: obviously having found a new particle, there is still much, much more to do at the lhc - we need to confirm that this new particle is the reason some particles have tangible mass while others are insubstantial - as proposed by peter higgs and other scientists, who predicted that a previously unknown particle must exist for our current understanding of the universe to work. and, for professor valentin khoze, director of durham university's institute for particle physics phenomenology (ippp), this discovery is just opening the door to others that could be even more exciting. the second part of the story about the higgs particle is even more exciting as it provides us with a window to new physics - a tool for the exploration of the truly unknown. the next stage will be a detailed and careful study of its properties. successful completion of this second stage will bring us closer to uncovering new physics, explaining dark matter and other mysteries of the universe. stephen hawking bet gordy kane (umich) $100 that the higgs would never be found at cern. wonder if he's conceded defeat? 12.24pm: still full of higgs related questions? cern theorist ignatios antoniadis has had a go at answering some of the public's most pressing queries here . broken down into the main points antoniadis says: ? the newly-discovered particle looks like the higgs boson but, as its properties have not been fully studied yet, a final label will "only come after further investigations". ? the cern scientists will specifically be looking at decay rates as these, together with mass, characterise particles. the particle could either decay "with the rates expected from the standard model (sm)", or it will decay differently- which will then beg the question of whether the sm needs "small adjustments...or if new physics processes need to be looked for in order to explain its nature". (i think this would be a pretty major upset.) ? the particle, because of its low mass, has allowed the scientific community to rule out theories such as "technicolor" and "some of the theoretical models used in supersymmetry. however, other supersymmetric or not scenarios could still apply, as well as extra-dimensional theories." ? the good news for theorists is that experimentalists may be able to provide us with this information about decay rates over the next few months. 12.38pm: and if after all this you still have questions relating to the-particle-that-may-be-higgs-but-is-not-for-sure, there'll be a live q+a taking place at 1pm here. my colleague laura oliver writes: got a question about the higgs boson, cern or the large hadron collider, but been too afraid to ask? as we report live from geneva on scientists' latest efforts to find the 'god particle', two leading physics professors will be online to take your questions. from 1pm bst we will have professor stefan soldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the school of physics and astronomy, university of manchester, and professor andy parker, professor of high energy physics at the university of cambridge, available to answer your questions about the higgs boson. 12.43pm: and some more higgs trivia (i'm not sure any of it is really trivial, but anyway) courtesy of the press association. q: what is the higgs boson and the higgs field? a: the higgs field has been described as a kind of cosmic "treacle" spread through the universe. as particles travel through the treacle they slow down, lose energy and get heavier. the higgs boson is the force-carrying particle that helps transmit the effects of the higgs field. q: what would the world be like without the higgs boson? a: according to the standard model theory, it would not be recognisable. without something to give mass to the basic building blocks of matter, everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with other particles. ordinary matter, as we know it, would not exist. q: how did the higgs boson get the nickname "the god particle"? a: a nobel laureate physicist from fermilab called leon lederman wrote a book in the early 1990s about the search for the higgs boson. his publishers coined the name as a marketable title for the book, but it's disliked by many scientists. 1.27pm: my colleague mary hamilton happens to have a brother with a phd in quantum mechanics (handy, that), who has spent his lunch break emailing his thoughts on the higgs announcement and what it all means. below the line but here's his answer to the burning question: was it a standard model higgs, or something else? well, according to today's results, both detectors actually saw a bigger excess in the diphoton channel - i.e. more than would be predicted with a standard model higgs. also the tau-tau channel showed nothing at all. that could mean that this isn't a sm higgs which would be what's know in the trade as "cool new science". having said that, those discrepancies are not yet very significant ( admitted to the bbc that he's lost his bet that the higgs particle wouldn't be found (see 12.09pm ). it seems i have just lost $100. the results, said hawking, "strongly suggest" that cern had found the higgs particle. if its properties turn out to be as expected, he said, "it will be strong evidence for the so-called standard model of particle physics, the theory that explains all our experiments so far." this is an important result and should guarantee higgs the nobel prize but it is a pity in a way because the great advances in physics have come from experiments that gave results we didn't expect. been on the airwaves telling the bbc why, for him, this day is one for the history books. this is without doubt in my opinion the biggest scientific discovery of my lifetime and without doubt one of the biggest scientific discoveries of all time, so i'm tremendously excited... this day will go down as one of the great days in the history of science i think, and that's not overly hyperbolic. cox said he almost felt shocked that "such a strange thing" had been shown to be true. this is a prediction that was made almost 50 years ago. and the prediction is that the universe, everywhere, empty space, everywhere you look, every little cubic centimetre of space in front of you and inside your body and across the universe, is rammed full of higgs particles, and everything that makes up your body, the little subatomic particles in your hand, are bouncing off them, and that's how they get their mass. and more than that the theory said that these higgs particles condensed out into empty space less than a billionth of a second after the universe began. it sounds very esoteric and fundamental. but what we've shown today is that's right. that's actually how the universe works. so it's one of the central planks of our understanding of how everything in the universe works. and even though, throughout my whole career as a particle physicist of 20 years now, this theory has been there, i think the realisation that it's actually right is quite shocking, actually; i'm quite shocked that such a strange thing has been shown to be true. 2.39pm: we're going to wrap up this live blog now. thanks for all your illuminating and engaged comments; i can only apologise for my woeful inability to understand almost anything that was said by the clever people of cern. for a brilliant write-up of what today means- and, to quote him, why "the real work begins" now- have a look at ian sample's higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle 09.43 edt on wednesday 4 july 2012. it was last modified at higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle contributor open for comments. in the greatest of ironies, proof of a god particle might prove the non-existence of god. what's with the 'boffin' thing in reference to the excellent mr. (dr.? prof.?) sample? isn't the guardian normally a bit more careful with personal and professional stereotyping? of couse, i retract this comment unreservedly if he actuall yet you refer to them as god's choice ;) add that turn of phrase to the wonderfully verboten "god damn particle" and we illustrate the power of human language to skew the world. which returns us to irony! clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. when this was all starting to come to the fore a couple of years ago or whenever it was (before the machine broke down - hope it was under guarantee) it sounded exciting - they were going to be doing all this smashing up of stuff in this hi tech tunnel and i was hoping there'd be some really cool photos and videos of it all happening. i liked ian sample's video. what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? how disappointing to discover that all we're going to get is data and a probability reading of the (god?) damn thing existing. once the higgs particle is detected and experiments are repeated a few times to be sure, what then? what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? the photon is probably the most important on a day-to-day level, since exchange of photons results in the electromagnetic force, which is what prevents everything from collapsing in a heap... congratulations to the scientists. great day for them (and the rest of us). money well spent europe. none so far but the apparent mass of the higgs is consistent with ss. electrons, on the other hand, do not appear to be composite - but they might be on scales smaller than those we can currently probe. observer1951: the universe we see is made of of energetically stable (relative to the lifespan of the universe) particles. the higgs particle is hugely unstable because it's so energetic. we have to put an awful lot of energy into one place in order to produce it; then fractions of a second later, the universe notices that we've piled a lot up and it avalanches down as other, more stable particles / portions of energy. it's these particles we can see and we work backwards to deduce where they came from. so if the higgs particle is unstable, the field isn't - particles don't actually have to really exist for them to have an effect - the quantum foam (at the smallest possible distance in the universe, the planck length) is popping particles in and out all the time, they're not really there, but things don't add up unless we take them into account. the higgs boson is unstable because it is energetically favourable for it to decay to something else. the higgs field is different thing from the particle - you could say the higgs boson is the physical manifestation of the field, and there is no problem with a stable field resulting in an unstable particle. higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

T	'god particle' a gateway to new vision of universe - france 24
C	a graphic from the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in geneva shows a proton-proton collision event measured in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experience in the search for the higgs boson. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries including dark matter. british physicist peter higgs smiles at a press conference on july 4, at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) offices in meyrin near geneva. after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists said on july 4 they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. participants take a rest early on july 4, before the opening of a seminar on the latest update in the 50-year search for the higgs boson pareticle at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) near geneva. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries afp - physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries including dark matter. the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) unveiled data from the large hadron collider on wednesday "consistent with the long-sought boson", an elusive particle thought to help explain why matter has mass. it was hailed as a huge moment for science by physicists gathered in australia, where cern's findings were unveiled via videolink from geneva at a landmark conference attended by hundreds of the field's top experts. scientists went into a frenzy following the announcement, speculating that it could one day make light speed travel possible by "un-massing" objects or allow huge items to be launched into space by "switching off" the higgs. cern scientist albert de roeck likened it to the discovery of electricity, when he said humanity could never have imagined its future applications. "what's really important for the higgs is that it explains how the world could be the way that it is in the first millionth of a second in the big bang," de roeck told afp. "can we apply it to something? at this moment my imagination is too small to do that." physicist ray volkas said "almost everybody" was hoping that, rather than fitting the so-called standard model of physics -- a theory explaining how particles fit together in the universe -- the higgs bosun would prove to be "something a bit different". "if that was the case that would point to all sorts of new physics, physics that might have something to do with dark matter," he said, referring to the hypothetical matter some suggest makes up most of the mass in the universe. "it could be, for example, that the higgs particle acts as a bridge between ordinary matter, which makes up atoms, and dark matter, which we know is a very important component of the universe." "that would have really fantastic implications for understanding all of the matter in the universe, not just ordinary atoms," he added. de roeck said scrutinising the new particle and determining whether it supported something other than the standard model would be the next step for cern scientists. clarification could be expected by the beginning of 2013; definitive proof that it fitted the standard model could take until 2015 when the (lhc) had more power and could harvest more data. de roeck said he would find it a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the standard model higgs". instead, he was hoping it would be a "gateway or a portal to new physics, to new theories which are actually running nature" such as supersymmetry, which hypothesises that there are five different higgs particles governing mass. the search for higgs -- the logical next step of which de roeck said would be searching for, and eventually being able to produce, dark matter particles -- has already had huge benefits to medicine and technology. volkas said the internet was born at cern as a solution to high-volume data-sharing and other major spin-offs were likely to follow as physicists continued to "push the boundaries of pure science". "we just want to know how the world works, but in order to answer those questions you have to develop new technologies," he said. funding for particle physics is already under scrutiny in north america, where the lhc's predecessor, the tevatron, was closed late last year due to financial constraints. de roeck said there were similar problems in europe, where physicists will meet in september to discuss research priorities for the next 20 years and whether they need and can afford an accelerator after the lhc. "that is going to be a tough fight," he said. "despite this momentous moment we have now, it doesn't necessarily bring the funding which one would require." he urged governments and other key contributors to see fundamental science as a "must" rather than a luxury.

C	physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries including dark matter. the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) unveiled data from the large hadron collider on wednesday "consistent with the long-sought higgs boson", an elusive particle thought to help explain why matter has mass. it was hailed as a huge moment for science by physicists gathered in australia, where cern's findings were unveiled via videolink from geneva at a landmark conference attended by hundreds of the field's top experts. scientists went into a frenzy following the announcement, speculating that it could one day make light speed travel possible by "un-massing" objects or allow huge items to be launched into space by "switching off" the higgs. cern scientist albert de roeck likened it to the discovery of electricity, when he said humanity could never have imagined its future applications. "what's really important for the higgs is that it explains how the world could be the way that it is in the first millionth of a second in the big bang," de roeck told afp. a graphic from the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in geneva shows a proton-proton collision event measured in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experience in the search for the higgs boson. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries including dark matter. "can we apply it to something? at this moment my imagination is too small to do that." physicist ray volkas said "almost everybody" was hoping that, rather than fitting the so-called standard model of physics -- a theory explaining how particles fit together in the universe -- the higgs bosun would prove to be "something a bit different". "if that was the case that would point to all sorts of new physics, physics that might have something to do with dark matter," he said, referring to the hypothetical matter some suggest makes up most of the mass in the universe. "it could be, for example, that the higgs particle acts as a bridge between ordinary matter, which makes up atoms, and dark matter, which we know is a very important component of the universe." "that would have really fantastic implications for understanding all of the matter in the universe, not just ordinary atoms," he added. de roeck said scrutinising the new particle and determining whether it supported something other than the standard model would be the next step for cern scientists. clarification could be expected by the beginning of 2013; definitive proof that it fitted the standard model could take until 2015 when the large hadron collider (lhc) had more power and could harvest more data. de roeck said he would find it a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the standard model higgs". instead, he was hoping it would be a "gateway or a portal to new physics, to new theories which are actually running nature" such as supersymmetry, which hypothesises that there are five different higgs particles governing mass. the search for higgs -- the logical next step of which de roeck said would be searching for, and eventually being able to produce, dark matter particles -- has already had huge benefits to medicine and technology. volkas said the internet was born at cern as a solution to high-volume data-sharing and other major spin-offs were likely to follow as physicists continued to "push the boundaries of pure science". "we just want to know how the world works, but in order to answer those questions you have to develop new technologies," he said. physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson, which is believed to confer mass. the particle is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern said in a statement, adding that further data was needed to identify the find. duration: 00:59 funding for particle physics is already under scrutiny in north america, where the lhc's predecessor, the tevatron, was closed late last year due to financial constraints. de roeck said there were similar problems in europe, where physicists will meet in september to discuss research priorities for the next 20 years and whether they need and can afford an accelerator after the lhc. "that is going to be a tough fight," he said. "despite this momentous moment we have now, it doesn't necessarily bring the funding which one would require." he urged governments and other key contributors to see fundamental science as a "must" rather than a luxury. afp's worldwide network the global network of agence france presse covers

(ap photo/cern) editorial use only - mandatory credit austin seeks to rewrite onerous development rules, amid neighborhood concerns - scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. 5th annual bug festival at zilker park

C	belgian physicist francois englert, left, and british physicist peter higgs right, answer journalists' questions at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin, near geneva, switzerland, wednesday."> belgian physicist francois englert, left, and british physicist peter higgs right, answer journalists' questions at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin, near geneva, switzerland, wednesday. geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 17-mile underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible.

T	the higgs boson - found at last ! | use celsias.com - reduce global ?celsius
C	it looks like they have found it - the elusive higgs boson particle , aka the god particle. awesome! large hadron collider in geneva may finally have tracked down the elusive higgs boson. results announced today at "if the higgs has been finally identified, this will be the biggest discovery in particle physics for forty years," said dr joel goldstein , leader of the cms activityin bristol's school of physics. the higgs boson is the essential connection between the mathematical theory of the universe, and the everyday world. without it, the fundamental particles which make up atoms would be massless, completely at odds with what we observe. at a deeper level, the higgs allows two of the four forces of nature to be treated as one simpler phenomenon, and completes the 'standard model' of particle physics first proposed in the 1970s. the search for the higgs requires the careful study of thousands of trillions of particle collisions at incredibly high energies. the lhc accelerates beams of protons around a 27km ring on the swiss-french border. on collision, the protons' energy is converted to new particles, which are detected by a series of huge and complex experiments. from around a billion collisions per second, a higgs boson is expected to be produced around once per minute - but only a fraction of these can be detected. the identification of the new particle is the first step in the lhc research programme, and opens the door to a huge range of possibilities. physicists will now accumulate much more data in order to carefully measure the properties of the particle - only then can they positively identify it. many physicists believe that the simplest version of higgs' theory must be modified by a new phenomenon called supersymmetry. this would also provide clues as to the origin of the mysterious 'dark matter' which occupies the galaxy alongside stars and planets, and would also point the way towards deeper and simpler theories of space and time. "these new results are a huge achievement, but really represent the first step on a long road of discovery," said dr dave newbold , head of the bristol particle physics group. "the really exciting physics is all ahead of us, and it may not turn out to be what we expect." the lhc will shut down in 2013 for two years, allowing the equipment which steers and controls the proton beams to be upgraded. from 2015, the accelerator will operate with twice its current energy and three times the number of collisions, putting new discoveries within reach. work on cms is carried out in bristol alongside the study of antimatter at the cern lhcb experiment, and preparations for future facilities that will allow the higgs to be 'mass-produced' and studied in detail. the higgs boson is a type of elementary, sub-atomic particle that is widely believed to play a key role in shaping the way the universe functions. confirming its existence is one of the main objectives of the large hadron collider (lhc), which is located at cern (the european organization for nuclear research) in switzerland. physicists have developed a theory called 'the standard model' to explain how the various types of elementary particle that make up the visible universe interact. with the exception of neutrino physics, results from other particle physics experiments match the standard model extremely well - but only if one missing piece, the higgs boson, is assumed to exist. based on the particles discovered to date, the standard model could not otherwise explain why some particles have mass (e.g. electrons), while others don't (e.g. photons which make up light). theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson is the key. so most physicists conclude that another elementary particle must exist - the higgs boson - and that this gives other particles their mass. in terms of our understanding of matter and the basic forces shaping the universe, this is a critical issue: without mass, there would be no matter. how does the discovery of the higgs boson compare to earlier scientific discoveries? the search for the higgs boson mirrors the discovery of the electron. the concept of the electron was first proposed in 1838 to explain the chemical properties of the atom but its presence was not confirmed by british physicist and nobel prize winner jj thompson until 1897. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. manipulating or harnessing phenomena such as electricity, magnetism and thermal conductivity rely on our understanding of the electron - applications include cathode ray tubes (television), radiotherapy treatments for cancer patients, lasers (cds, energy, manufacturing etc), microscopes, and, of course, particle accelerators like the lhc. spintronics, the technique of manipulating electron 'spin', has the potential to bring us faster computers, increased data storage and more efficient photovoltaic cells. our search for knowledge about our universe continues and it is impossible to determine where it will lead in terms of fundamental knowledge or applications. for example, we do not know why photons, the particles that make up light, have no mass. jj thompson could not have predicted where his discovery of the electron would lead, and similarly we do not know where the discovery of the higgs boson could lead. each advance opens up a new frontier of science. it's believed that higgs bosons are responsible for determining how much mass other types of elementary particle have. the theory goes as follows: countless numbers of higgs bosons make up an energy field ('the higgs field') that extends throughout the universe. when other types of elementary particle move through the higgs field, some do so very easily (like an arrow flying through the air); this results in them having little mass and, in some cases, no mass at all. but other, less 'streamlined' types of elementary particle don't move through the higgs field so easily and this results in them having a relatively high mass. sub-atomic particles are divided into two categories: bosons and fermions. generally speaking, bosons are force-carrying particles while fermions are associated with matter. the higgs boson is named after professor peter higgs, a theoretical physicist at the university of edinburgh. professor higgs was one of a number of physicists who predicted the existence of what's now known as the higgs boson, which has been dubbed 'the most sought-after particle in modern physics'. a number of other researchers, including thomas kibble of imperial independently or jointly proposed a similar mechanism, but it has become generally known as the higgs mechanism. you can not directly see a higgs boson. it's believed that, with the right experiment in place, a decaying higgs boson would leave behind a detectable 'footprint' in the form of a unique configuration of other particles. higgs bosons should (according to current theories) be created a few times in every trillion high energy particle collisions at the lhc. confirming the existence of the higgs boson will provide vital evidence that the standard model accurately accounts for how and why energy and matter behave as they do. it would act as a springboard to further research and an improved understanding of the universe. ultimately, it may have spin-off benefits in fields as diverse as medicine, computing, electronics and manufacturing. posted on july 5, 2012. listed in: pledge to do these related actions this winter instead of cranking up the thermostat, try out a space heater. they're cheap, ...

"can we apply it to something? at this moment my imagination is too small to do that." physicist ray volkas said "almost everybody" was hoping that, rather than fitting the so-called standard model of physics -- a theory explaining how particles fit together in the universe -- the higgs boson would prove to be "something a bit different". "if that was the case that would point to all sorts of new physics, physics that might have something to do with dark matter," he said, referring to the hypothetical invisible matter thought to make up much of the universe. enlarge british physicist peter higgs smiles at a press conference on july 4, at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) offices in meyrin near geneva. after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists said on july 4 they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. "it could be, for example, that the higgs particle acts as a bridge between ordinary matter, which makes up atoms, and dark matter, which we know is a very important component of the universe." "that would have really fantastic implications for understanding all of the matter in the universe, not just ordinary atoms," he added. de roeck said scrutinising the new particle and determining whether it supported something other than the standard model would be the next step for cern scientists. clarification could be expected by the beginning of 2013; definitive proof that it fitted the standard model could take until 2015 when the lhc had more power and could harvest more data. the lhc is due to go offline for a two-year refit in december that will see its firepower doubled to 14 trillion electronvolts -- a huge step forward in the search for new particles and clues about what holds them all together. de roeck said he would find it a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the standard model higgs". instead, he was hoping it would be a "gateway or a portal to new physics , to new theories which are actually running nature" such as supersymmetry, which hypothesises that there are five different higgs particles governing mass. the hunt for higgs -- the logical next step of which de roeck said would be searching for, and eventually being able to produce, dark matter particles -- has already had huge benefits to medicine and technology. volkas said the internet was born at cern as a solution to high-volume data-sharing and other major spin-offs were likely to follow as physicists continued to "push the boundaries of pure science". enlarge participants take a rest early on july 4, before the opening of a seminar on the latest update in the 50-year search for the higgs boson pareticle at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) near geneva. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries "we just want to know how the world works, but in order to answer those questions you have to develop new technologies," he said. funding for particle physics is already under scrutiny in north america, where the lhc's predecessor, the illinois-based tevatron run by fermilab, was closed late last year due to financial constraints. fermilab director pier oddone said money was a "big, big issue" threatening progress in the united states and he hoped the higgs discovery would spur greater funding from us agencies and congress. "what i would hope is that this excitement, this focus of the world's attention on this discovery, will actually help a lot in stimulating and reestablishing particle physics in north america," oddone said. de roeck said there were similar problems in europe, where physicists will meet in september to discuss research priorities for the next 20 years and whether they need and can afford an accelerator after the lhc. "that is going to be a tough fight," he said. "despite this momentous moment we have now, it doesn't necessarily bring the funding which one would require." he urged governments and other key contributors to see fundamental science as a "must" rather than a luxury. "this is the only way we can actually move on and have a deeper understanding of how things work. it can only be in our benefit exploring that."

T	higgs boson found: scientists find 'god particle' after 40-year search in a 'momentous day for science' | mail online
C	professor higgs wipes a tear from his eye as fellow scientists find his 'god particle' on 'momentous day for science' - 40 years after he predicted its existence discovery of particle is most important in physics in decades leading physicists watch announcement at cern in switzerland end of 40-year quest for 'missing' particle last jigsaw piece that proves our view of universe is right 'god particle' gives particles that make up atoms their mass prof higgs, 83: 'i had no idea this would happen in my lifetime' by rob waugh and fiona macrae science correspondent published: 02:17 est, 4 july 2012 | updated: 10:16 est, 5 july 2012 comments ( 983 ) share the search for the 'god particle' is over. almost half a century after the existence of the higgs boson - the particle that holds the universe together and gives it substance - was predicted, jubilant scientists announced that they appear to have found it. rolf heuer, director-general of cern, the home of the large hadron collider, told a packed auditorium: 'as a layman, i would say we have it.' he predicted the discovery will shed light on other mysteries of the universe and added: 'we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature.' scroll down for video professor higgs, 83, wiped a tear from his eye as the findings were announced, and later said: 'it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime.' two high-energy photons collide. their energy (the red lines) is measured in by an 'electromagnetic calorimeter'. the yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision. the pale blue volume shows the track through which the particles are sent others compared the significance of the sighting to the first moon landing and to christopher columbus discovering america. newcastle-born professor peter higgs, who dreamed up the concept of the particle that now bears his name while walking in the scottish highlands in 1964, was present at the announcement and wiped a tear from his eye. he said: 'i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge.' stephen hawking, who had bet $100 (?64) that the higgs boson would never be found, said: 'this is an important result and should earn peter higgs the nobel prize.' more... 'britain's atlantis' found at bottom of north sea - a huge undersea kingdom swallowed by the sea in 6500bc michael hanlon: as rumours fly that physicists have discovered 'the god particle', are we about to know the mind of god? david cameron offered his congratulations and said he hoped the breakthrough would inspire a generation of researchers to keep britain at the forefront of scientific discoveries. the higgs boson's role is to give the particles that make up atoms their mass. without this mass, they would zip around the cosmos, unable to bind together to form the atoms that make stars and planets - and people. despite its fabled properties, the particle has eluded previous searches and not all scientists believed in its existence. joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, announces the discovery of a particle that corresponds to theories of the higgs boson at cern today the particle accelerator: it is within these tubes that physicists are hunting for the 'god' particle to try to pin it down, scientists at the large hadron collider near geneva smashed together beams of protons - the 'hearts of atoms' - at close to the speed of light, recreating conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the big bang. if professor higgs, of edinburgh university, was right, a few higgs bosons should have been created in every trillion collisions. although they would rapidly decay, they should have left a recognisable footprint. yesterday morning, two teams of scientists running independent experiments in secret from each other revealed they had found 'clear signs' of a new particle. however, the teams, which included hundreds of britons, stopped short of declaring it the higgs boson, saying more work is needed to confirm its properties. why the higgs matters - what the new particle means the higgs was proposed in 1964 - it is the last missing piece of the standard model, the theory that describes the basic building blocks of the universe. the other 11 particles predicted by the model have been found - the higgs is the last jigsaw piece. if the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board. theory has it that as the universe cooled after the big bang, an invisible force known as the higgs field formed. this field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles - or higgs bosons.as other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the higgs boson will be long term, but they could be in fields as diverse as medicine, computing and manufacturing. experts compare the search for the higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. the idea of the electron - a subatomic particle - was first floated in 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. a century on, the electron's existence underpins modern science. our understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from television and cds to radiotherapy for cancer patients. others were not so reticent. jim al-khalili, professor of physics at the university of surrey, said: 'after all the hype and speculation, after decades of designing the world's most ambitious experiment and months of careful checking of data, today is the pay-off. 'the higgs really does exist. nobel prizes all round please.' professor themis bowcock, head of particle physics at liverpool university, said: 'very few scientists would argue privately that this is not a higgs particle. 'half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature. 'for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america.' one of the reasons for the caution at cern is that while the new particle has so far behaved liked the elusive higgs boson it is lighter than expected. this opens up the possibility of there being more than one higgs boson and could lead to a new understanding of dark matter, the mysterious substance thought to make up a quarter of the universe. professor tejinder virdee, of imperial college london, who helped lead one of the two teams of scientists behind the discovery, said: 'this breaks the way to looking at a new vista in physics. it is a very exciting moment.' professor john womersley. chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, said: 'they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science.' 'this is indeed a new particle,' said lab spokesman joe incandela. 'this is something that may in the end be one of the biggest discoveries or observations of any new phenomena that we've had in our field in the last 30 or 40 years,' said incandela. the discovery fills in the last gap in the 'standard model' of physics - proving einstein right, and possibly leading to new technologies built on our understanding of the workings of the atom. master of the universe: the quiet man who dreamt up the 'god particle' while walking in the highlands peter higgs in the sixties. the scientist dreamed up the idea of the higgs boson while walking in the cairngorms in 1964 until recently, professor peter higgs was as unknown to most of the world as the famous particle that bears his name. today the quiet physicist, now retired from the university of edinburgh, is fast becoming a global celebrity as creator of the theory behind the 'god particle'. prof higgs, 83, has been waiting since 1964 for science to catch up with his ideas about the higgs boson. it was in that year he dreamed up the concept in a moment of inspiration while walking in the cairngorms. two scientific papers followed, the second of which was initially rejected and then finally published in the respected journal physical review letters. prof higgs's groundbreaking proposal was that particles acquire mass by interacting with an all-pervading field spread throughout the universe. the more they interact, the more massive and heavy they become. a 'boson' particle was needed to carry and transmit the effect of the field - the higgs boson. peter higgs was born in newcastle in 1929, the son of a bbc sound engineer. after his family moved to bristol, he proved a brilliant pupil at cotham grammar school before going on to read theoretical physics at king's college london. he was awarded first class honours in 1950, and after failing to secure a lectureship at king's college, set off for scotland. in 2006, he retired from the university of edinburgh, assuming the title of emeritus professor. never one to blow his own trumpet, prof higgs is described by friends and colleagues as 'very unassuming' and shy. some believe his retiring nature might even have held back his career. now, despite his best efforts to keep a low profile, the spotlight is turning on him. british physicist peter higgs (right) is welcomed by european organization for nuclear research (cern) director-general rolf-dieter heuer (left) british physicist peter higgs arrives for the conference near geneva in december last year scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) - the 'big bang' particle accelerator which recreates conditions a billionth of a second after the birth of the universe - revealed they had caught a first tantalising glimpse of the higgs. since then they have sifted through vast quantities of data from innumerable high energy collisions in an effort to reduce the odds of being wrong. more... 'britain's atlantis' found at bottom of north sea - a huge undersea kingdom swallowed by the sea in 6500bc michael hanlon: as rumours fly that physicists have discovered 'the god particle', are we about to know the mind of god? a statistical standard of proof known as 'five sigma' is the ultimate confirmation of a discovery. 'we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma,' said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, 'but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication.' 'the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found,' said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. 'the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks.' inside: the giant project is the most enormous piece of scientific apparatus ever constructed, and is buried 100m beneath the ground an aerial view of the swiss-french border, indicating the route of the large hadron collider god particle: key to the cosmos the higgs boson is - or was - a key missing piece in the jigsaw for physicists in trying to understand how the universe works. its discovery will allow them to shed new light on the dawn of time and how we came to be here. scientists believe that a fraction of a second after the big bang that gave birth to the universe, an invisible energy field called the higgs field formed. this has been described as a kind of 'cosmic treacle' across the universe. as particles passed through it, they picked up mass, giving them size and shape and allowing them to form the atoms that make up you, everything around you and everything in the universe. this was the theory proposed in 1964 by former grammar school boy professor higgs that has now apparently been confirmed. without the higgs field particles would simply whizz around space in the same way as light does. a boson is a type of sub-atomic particle. every energy field has a specific particle that governs its interaction with what's around it. what yesterday's news means for the man in the street is unclear but it could lead to discoveries in fields such as medicine, computing and electronics. for physicists it could shed light on other mysteries of the universe. 'it's hard not to get excited by these results,' said cern research director sergio bertolucci. 'we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point.' prof higgs, who first postulated the theory more than 40 years ago, told the bbc: 'i'm rather surprised that it happened in my lifetime - i certainly had no idea it would happen in my lifetime at the beginning, more than 40 years ago, because at the beginning people had no idea about where to look for it, so it's really amazing for me to find out that it's really enough... for a discovery claim. 'i think it shows amazing dedication by the young people involved with these colossal collaborations to persist in this way, on what is a really a very difficult task. i congratulate them.' at the lhc, scientists shoot two beams of protons - the 'hearts' of atoms - at each other round 27 kilometres of circular tunnels at almost the speed of light. when the protons smash together the enormous energies involved cause them to decay into an array of more fundamental particles. these may then decay further into yet more particles. physicists needed the higgs to plug a gaping hole in the 'standard model', the theory that explains all the particles, forces and interactions making up the universe. so far nothing has been observed to account for mass, and the fact that some particles weigh more than others. according to the theory, the higgs boson is the emissary of an all-pervading 'higgs field' that gives matter mass. the more particles interact with the field, the more massive they become and the heavier they are. a model of the large hadron collider (lhc) tunnel is seen in the cern (european organization for nuclear research) visitors' center a standard model universe without the higgs boson could not exist. everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with anything else. there would be no atoms, made from conglomerations of protons, neutrons and electrons, no ordinary matter, and no us. finding no evidence of the higgs would mean tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board with a completely new set of theories.' british scientists congratulate the cern team 'for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america.' - prof themis bowcock, university of liverpool british experts queued to heap praise on the discovery of a new sub-atomic particle bearing the hallmarks of the higgs boson. professor valentin khoze, director of durham university's institute for particle physics phenomenology (ippp), said: 'the mounting evidence that higgs bosons have been produced and detected at the large hadron collider experiment at cern is a triumph for particle physics. 'without the higgs particle, other particles, such as electrons and quarks, would be massless and the universe would not be what it is. 'now, with the amazing results from the lhc, we are finally finding growing experimental evidence that the higgs really exists. 'the second part of the story about the higgs particle is even more exciting as it provides us with a window to new physics - a tool for the exploration of the truly unknown.' professor jordan nash, head of high energy physics at imperial college london, said: 'this is a fantastic result. 'we are all thrilled to be a part of this discovery and are looking forward with anticipation to studying this new particle and whatever surprises its behaviour may have in store for us.' professor jerome gauntlett, head of theoretical physics at imperial college london, said: 'the discovery of the higgs boson is a truly great moment for science. 'its origins go back to the 1960s with enormous contributions made by peter higgs in edinburgh and by tom kibble and nobel laureate abdus salam at imperial. 'it is fantastic moment for british science that 50 years later on we have received such dramatic confirmation of their profound ideas. like all great discoveries, more detailed studies of the higgs are likely to have a huge impact on future fundamental scientific inquiry. 'i expect that they will illuminate the nature of the mysterious dark matter that pervades the universe, whether or not there are extra dimensions in addition to the three space dimensions that we observe, and ultimately how to unify the standard model of particle physics with einstein's theory of gravity.' british physicist peter higgs (l) talks to fabiola gianotti, atlas experiment spokesperson, next to cern director general rolf heuer after the news conference professor paul dauncey, professor of particle physics at imperial college london said: 'this is a major breakthrough for our understanding of the universe. 'if this new particle is what we think it is, then it is a completely new type of particle never seen before. we can think of it as the final piece of the puzzle, completing what is considered to be the 'standard' theory. 'but no-one thinks that's really the end of the story, so it might also be the beginning of a new chapter in physics, the first step to a more fundamental view of how everything came to exist. that's why physicists are excited; we just don't know where this will lead.' professor sir timothy o'shea, principal of the university of edinburgh, said: 'we are delighted at this significant development in the search for the higgs boson, and congratulate professor peter higgs on this. 'this particle is integral to our understanding of the physical world and evidence of its existence is a testament to professor higgs and to all the scientists who are working to uncover it. 'professor higgs has inspired many colleagues and students over the years, some of whom have also gone on to become involved in the large hadron collider experiments. his legacy will continue to inspire future generations of physicists, at edinburgh and beyond.' participants applaud after the presentation results during a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson prof stefan soldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the university of manchester, said: 'today we have witnessed a discovery which gives unique insight into our understanding of the universe and the origin of the masses of fundamental particles. 'there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists and we now have to understand its properties and whether it behaves exactly as predicted by theory.' professor dave charlton, deputy spokesperson for the atlas experiment at the university of birmingham's school of physics and astronomy, said: 'many people have been working night and day to analyse the fresh data from the lhc which has been pouring in this year, which has allowed us to reveal these exciting preliminary results today. 'the tantalising hints we saw in december are repeated and strengthened in the new atlas data, so we're now quite confident that we're seeing a new particle. 'finding out if it's got all the properties of the standard model's higgs boson will need a lot more data and painstaking work. we're now opening a new chapter of fundamental physics, as the lhc was designed to do.' prof themis bowcock, head of particle physics at the university of liverpool, who has worked on the lhc, said: 'this is cast-iron proof that a new particle has been discovered. it looks like the higgs. 'for physicists the dice are definitely now loaded in favour of a discovery. based on the cern results alone there appears to be less than one chance in a million that this is fake, which is roughly the same probability as flipping a coin heads-up 21 times in a row. very few physicists would privately argue that this is not a higgs particle. 'half a century after it was first proposed, and after a monumental effort by generations of physicists around the world, the discovery of the higgs represents a major breakthrough in our fundamental understanding of nature. 'for physicists, this is the equivalent of columbus discovering america.' video: prof higgs makes rare public appearance at press conference

"as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," said heuer. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," said heuer. moments later, higgs, 83, stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution - a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" - scientists around the world celebrated the moment. a video feed from melbourne, australia, where an international physics conference is set to begin, showed an auditorium packed with cheering scientists. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at fermilab, longtime home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, some 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," lincoln said. "people were riveted. discovery is what scientists live for."& amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; lt; /p> the announcement was one many ohio state university physicists had long pursued. "i've been working for 19 years looking forward to this day," said stan durkin, an osu experimental high-energy physicist. "i can't express how excited i am." the search for the higgs boson particle stretches back decades and finally settled at the large hadron collider near geneva after efforts to build a super collider in the united states fell apart. ohio was among 25 states that bid on the project, but was quickly removed from a list of 25 competing states in 1987. texas was ultimately selected, but congress put a halt to construction in 1993 after projected construction costs soared past $12 billion. durkin helped design and build super-sensitive detectors that the hadron needs to track high-speed particles, called muons, created by the hadron collider's subatomic collisions. "all of the tracks in the pictures you were shown were read out by ohio state electronics," durkin said. christopher hill, an osu physicist and one of the leaders of the hadron collider's compact muon solenoid (cms) experiment, said the announcement follows observations made back in december that hinted at the higgs. hill said more research was needed to help confirm that a new particle had been discovered. "we used the same exact analysis techniques, but used twice as much data," hill said. hill and richard hughes, another osu physicist, said years of research must follow to help reassure scientists that what they've found is the higgs and not something unexpected. "the next step is to say we need to study this thing to see if it behaves the way we would expect it to," hughes said. "is it consistent with everything we expect from the higgs boson?" with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 - set two years ago to align with the conference in melbourne - cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the collider, which straddles the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation yesteday morning. the discovery of the particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found - and the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more-massive objects get tangled up in the field - and hence, slowed down as they move - more than less-massive objects. the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. while the higgs boson research hasn't produce any direct benefits, the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, including the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar-energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - also have resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. franklin county's four auto title offices reopened this afternoon after being closed yesterday morning because of power outages and a statewide computer failure. the offices all reopened about 2 p.m. this afternoon, and will remain open during normal business hours today. the offices will close at 5 p.m. except for the auto title west location at 1970 w. broad st., which is open until 5:30 p.m. trafficker gets 30-year sentence for forcing 16-year-old into sex business

"as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," said heuer. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," said heuer. moments later, higgs, 83, stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution - a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" - scientists around the world celebrated the moment. a video feed from melbourne, australia, where an international physics conference is set to begin, showed an auditorium packed with cheering scientists. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at fermilab, longtime home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, some 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," lincoln said. "people were riveted. discovery is what scientists live for."& amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; lt; /p> the announcement was one many ohio state university physicists had long pursued. "i've been working for 19 years looking forward to this day," said stan durkin, an osu experimental high-energy physicist. "i can't express how excited i am." the search for the higgs boson particle stretches back decades and finally settled at the large hadron collider near geneva after efforts to build a super collider in the united states fell apart. ohio was among 25 states that bid on the project, but was quickly removed from a list of 25 competing states in 1987. texas was ultimately selected, but congress put a halt to construction in 1993 after projected construction costs soared past $12 billion. durkin helped design and build super-sensitive detectors that the hadron needs to track high-speed particles, called muons, created by the hadron collider's subatomic collisions. "all of the tracks in the pictures you were shown were read out by ohio state electronics," durkin said. christopher hill, an osu physicist and one of the leaders of the hadron collider's compact muon solenoid (cms) experiment, said the announcement follows observations made back in december that hinted at the higgs. hill said more research was needed to help confirm that a new particle had been discovered. "we used the same exact analysis techniques, but used twice as much data," hill said. hill and richard hughes, another osu physicist, said years of research must follow to help reassure scientists that what they've found is the higgs and not something unexpected. "the next step is to say we need to study this thing to see if it behaves the way we would expect it to," hughes said. "is it consistent with everything we expect from the higgs boson?" with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 - set two years ago to align with the conference in melbourne - cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the collider, which straddles the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation yesteday morning. the discovery of the particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found - and the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more-massive objects get tangled up in the field - and hence, slowed down as they move - more than less-massive objects. the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. while the higgs boson research hasn't produce any direct benefits, the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, including the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar-energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - also have resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. franklin county's four auto title offices reopened this afternoon after being closed yesterday morning because of power outages and a statewide computer failure. the offices all reopened about 2 p.m. this afternoon, and will remain open during normal business hours today. the offices will close at 5 p.m. except for the auto title west location at 1970 w. broad st., which is open until 5:30 p.m. trafficker gets 30-year sentence for forcing 16-year-old into sex business

T	higgs boson cost stephen hawking $100! : europe, news - india today
C	god particle discovery: a closer look at higgs boson's indian connect scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" on wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the god particle", which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorise occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed on wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible.

"thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." comments by posting to this site, you agree to our copyright record publishing co, llc. 1995-2012. all rights reserved.

T	jewish indy - ''the god particle''
C	''the god particle'' posted wednesday, july 04 @ 14:27:19 edt eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle geneva (ap) -- to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, `"what do we have?' " the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs - that was the question wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say if it was part of the standard model. but he told the audience the discovery appears to be very close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model (of physics) is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. sorry, comments are not available for this article. copyright ? 2005 by francisco burzi. this is free software, and you may redistribute it under the gpl . php-nuke comes with absolutely no warranty, for details, see the

C	physicists celebrate evidence of elusive 'god particle' scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of physics. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists shed tears reflecting on the decades of work that brought them to this momentous occasion. dhiman chakraborty, northern illinois university physics professor and leader of the group of niu physicists participating with the atlas team, said it's a day of great excitement and brings a sense of humble achievement following decades of work. niu faculty and students have been involved in such work at both fermilab and cern. niu physics professor david hedin said work niu faculty and students did at fermilab set the stage, as the development of technologies used at cern occurred during experiments at fermilab. chakraborty said niu group members contributed to simulation and calibration of the detector, identification of some of the particles the higgs boson decays into and ensured good quality data were taken. hedin said experiments done at fermilab yielded data that strongly indicated the new particle was the higgs boson, but cern now has more data and evidence of it. but it's a combination of work done in both places, he said. chakraborty added that it was a huge team effort, and niu's involvement is significant. faculty and students first began working at cern in 2007, he said. "a discovery of this sort only comes around every 30, 40 years," he said. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva on the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing in a circle at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer-clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of about 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted.

C	physicists celebrate evidence of elusive 'god particle' scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of physics. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists shed tears reflecting on the decades of work that brought them to this momentous occasion. dhiman chakraborty, northern illinois university physics professor and leader of the group of niu physicists participating with the atlas team, said it's a day of great excitement and brings a sense of humble achievement following decades of work. niu faculty and students have been involved in such work at both fermilab and cern. niu physics professor david hedin said work niu faculty and students did at fermilab set the stage, as the development of technologies used at cern occurred during experiments at fermilab. chakraborty said niu group members contributed to simulation and calibration of the detector, identification of some of the particles the higgs boson decays into and ensured good quality data were taken. hedin said experiments done at fermilab yielded data that strongly indicated the new particle was the higgs boson, but cern now has more data and evidence of it. but it's a combination of work done in both places, he said. chakraborty added that it was a huge team effort, and niu's involvement is significant. faculty and students first began working at cern in 2007, he said. "a discovery of this sort only comes around every 30, 40 years," he said. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva on the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing in a circle at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer-clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of about 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a [17-mile] underground tunnel. the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the theory got started. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," incandela said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." view/add comments there have been no comments made about this story. add comments there are 47 hours, 33 minutes remaining to comment on this story. copyright ? 2012 daily chronicle. all rights reserved.

T	northwest herald | physicists celebrate evidence of 'missing cornerstone' particle
C	physicists celebrate evidence of 'missing cornerstone' particle geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 17-mile underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. view/add comments there have been no comments made about this story. add comments there are 47 hours, 26 minutes remaining to comment on this story. copyright ? 2012 northwest herald. all rights reserved.

T	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle what happens inside the large hadron collider. scientists at cern, near geneva, have this morning announced the likely discovery of the higgs boson particle. photograph: cern 7.17am: good morning all. two teams of physicists at the cern laboratory near geneva are preparing today to announce their latest efforts to discover the participants take a rest early before the opening of the seminar. photograph: denis balibouse/afp/getty images the elusive "god particle" has become the most sought-after particle in modern science. its discovery would be proof of an invisible energy field that fills the vacuum of space, and excitement in the scientific community is at fever pitch. peter higgs, the edinburgh university physicist who proposed the idea of the particle in 1964, is flying in to geneva, as are two other men who published similar theories at around the same time: fran?ois englert, professor emeritus at the free university of brussels (ulb) in belgium, and tom kibble, professor emeritus at imperial college london. there have been rumours, speculation, and, last night, even an apparent leak from the laboratory when a the guardian's ian sample has flown to geneva and i'll be live-blogging this potentially historic morning on this page. 7.38am: now, two video links for your viewing pleasure. and here is a video from the guardian's own resident boffin, science correspondent ian sample. heroically, he attempts to explain the higgs boson by means of a tray from our canteen and some coloured ping pong balls. british physicist peter higgs (right) arrives at the seminar. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 7.52am: clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. now, the anticipation mounts. 8.02am: and we're off. first up is joe incandela, the leader of the team using the cms detector to search for new particles. he'll be followed by fabiola gianotti from the other team using the atlas detector. he says the results are "very strong, very solid". 8.13am: as incandela speaks, the brilliant ian sample is live-tweeting from cern. july 4, 2012 and we're keeping our observations extremely serious in keeping with the potentially historic nature of the day. 8.21am: i'm not going to lie: this is a little above my gcse 8.24am: reuters has just posted a flash update that claims cern scientists have discovered a new sub-atomic particle that could be the higgs boson. scientists at the cern research centre have discovered a new subatomic particle that could be the elusive higgs boson, which is believed to be crucial in the formation of the universe. "i can confirm that a particle has been discovered that is consistent with the higgs boson theory," said john womersley, chief executive of the uk's science & technology facilities council, at an event in london. joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle told an audience at cern near geneva: "this is a preliminary result, but we think it's very strong and very solid." incandela: says when they combine the results for two decay channels they get five sigma for the 8.43am: more interpretative tweets courtesy of those who can interpret these results. and combined - 5 sigma. round of applause. that's a discovery of a higgs - like particle at cms. they thank lhc for the data! particle physics threshold for discovery. it roughly means that you're 99.9999% sure 8.48am: incandela has finished. there's warm applause. his summary: all channels combined, sensitivity is 4.9 sigma. all results are consistent. his reflection from incandela's presentation is: huge question ongoing: are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new? easiest way to make different channels mismatch is to add new particles to your theory that couple to the higgs, and enter as virtual particles that modify different decay rates. full employment for both experimentalists and theorists! 8.55am: up now is fabiola giannotti, leader of the 3,000-strong group that works on the collider's five-storey atlas detector. a little piece about her and her work at the lhc last year. the appointment put her in the top ranks of a profession dominated by men. she came to physics from an education steeped in ancient greek, philosophy and the history of art - she had also trained as a pianist at the milan conservatory. but she ultimately chose physics to answer the big question of why things are as they are. "physics is, unfortunately, often seen as a male subject; sterile and without charm or emotion," she told the cern magazine. "but this is not true, because physics is art, aesthetics, beauty and symmetry." brian cox. in simple language, cms have discovered a new boson, and it behaves like the standard model higgs 9.05am: ap's take on incandela's presentation. one of the two independent teams at the world's biggest atom smasher says it has found strong evidence of a new subatomic particle that looks like the one believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. joe incandela, leader of one of the teams, told scientists at the european center for nuclear research, or cern, that the data has reached the level of certainty needed for a discovery. but he has not yet confirmed that the new particle is indeed the tiny and elusive higgs boson, popularly referred to as the "god particle." 9.09am: the new scientist, reporting from the auditorium, says cern has pre-empted gianotti. and the results from atlas also look exciting. 9.14am: "both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev," confirms a press release from cern. this release as saying: we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage, but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication. the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks. and sergio bertolucci, research director of cern, says: it's hard not to get excited by these results. we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data. the results presented today are labelled preliminary, the statement adds. they are based on data collected in 2011 and 2012, with the 2012 data still under analysis. publication of the analyses shown today is expected around the end of july. a more complete picture of today's observations will emerge later this year after the lhc provides the experiments with more data. the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe. are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient in the standard model of particle physics? or is it something more exotic? the standard model describes the fundamental particles from which we, and every visible thing in the universe, are made, and the forces acting between them. all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about 4% of the total. a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96% of the universe that remains obscure. positive identification of the new particle's characteristics will take considerable time and data. but whatever form the higgs particle takes, our knowledge of the fundamental structure of matter is about to take a major step forward. 9.21am: first reaction from peter higgs has just landed in my inbox. according to a statement sent by edinburgh university, the physicist says he is "astounded" at the speed with which the results have emerged and is preparing to celebrate. scientists at cern are to be congratulated on today's results, which are a great achievement for the large hadron collider and other experiments leading up to this. i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge. participants applaud after the presentation of the atlas experiments. photograph: denis balibouse/ap 9.23am: gianotti is still presenting atlas's results but the reaction is already pouring in. here's are the first few paragraphs from there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at cern , home of the large hadron collider near geneva, who announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. 9.29am: "#cern" is trending worldwide. as is #higgs, and #godparticle (sorry), and atlas. no #higgsteria yet though, despite a valiant effort by social media types. 9.32am: today's discovery is "unbelievably exciting", according to harvard physicist lisa randall. i really didn't expect this. they got enough data and improved analysis to the point where we know about a new particle months before i expected (based on asking lots of people)! it is unbelievably exciting. , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern, had this evaluation for ian over in geneva: is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion. a representation of traces of a proton-proton collision in the search for the higgs boson, released by cern. photograph: afp/getty images atlas - round of applause + cheers. 5 sigma discovery at 126.5 gev standard model expectation would be 4.6 sigma, so compatible with sm prediction july 4, 2012 "i'm not done yet; there's more to come!" she laughs. she has these guys in the palm of her hand. 9.41am: some physicists are being more certain about interpreting these results than others. for professor stefan s?ldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the university of manchester, "there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists". today we have witnessed a discovery which gives unique insight into our understanding of the universe and the origin of the masses of fundamental particles. there is no doubt that the higgs particle exists and we now have to understand its properties and whether it behaves exactly as predicted by theory. this discovery is the first milestone of the lhc physics programme and opens the door to many more exciting discoveries by the lhc experiments in the next decade. 9.44am: rolf heuer, director general of cern, offers this verdict: as a layman i would say: i think we have it. you agree? the audience claps. i think that's a yes. 9.46am: heuer flashes up on screen a slide that says cern have discovered "a particle consistent with the higgs boson- but which one?" so, while this is undoubtedly a milestone with "global implications", he says, it is also the beginning of a lot more research and investigation. but, he adds, "i think we can be very, very optimistic". 9.49am: peter higgs, who first proposed the idea of this boson in 1964 and is now 83, may have shed a tear or two there- a sight which seems to have got everyone else going too. #higgs is crying... it's a great day for physics. i am proud of being a physician :?) 9.58am: peter higgs has just been asked to say a few words. "for me it's a really incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," he said, giving his congratulations to everyone involved in what he described as a "tremendous achievement". 10.16am: earlier i pointed out that four of the 10 worldwide trends on twitter were higgs-related. i erred. there were five- but one of them was comic sans. turns out that, instead of remarking on the incredible achievements of the physicists at cern, some people would prefer to ridicule them for presenting their results in a funny font. cern need a design partner - comic sans for a serious presentation of breakthrough findings! really? cern's higgs presentation just added weight to the theory that comic sans is a terrible font. 10.18am: press conference time. more layman's terms please! first question goes straight to the point: "have you found the higgs boson or not?" heuer replies that, as he said earlier, in layman's terms, they have "got it". but as a scientist i say 'what do we have?' we have a boson. now we have to discover what kind of boson it is. 10.25am: for anyone who's just joined the fun, you can watch the live stream 10.28am: all the journalists are begging for layman's terms. rolf heuer of cern is trying all kinds of inventive allegories to explain the discovery. is it working? not entirely sure. 10.31am: were they surprised by how quickly they made this discovery? after all, points out one journalist, "supersymmetry" was what they were expected to hit upon first. yes, replies heuer. gianotti agrees, attributing the speed to the "impressive performance of the accelerator" and the experiments which have worked very well. incandela says that this discovery could actually help in the search for supersymmetry. in fact, the existence of a higgs-like boson actually is a very strong motivation for the existence of supersymmetry...we're going to try and hunt it down. 10.37am: ooo, we're into rumsfeldian territory here. a spokesman says they also want to go after the unknown unknowns. 10.38am: how did the leaders of atlas and cms feel upon completing this discovery? like "walking on air", says incandela. it was a magnificent moment to see the reaction of the community. gianotti praises the "dedication, the competence, the talent" of everyone in her team, atlas. 10.45am: john ellis of cern has emailed this evaluation to the guardian's ian sample. there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter. heuer has just had another valiant effort at explaining the science in terms a small child would understand. how close is what they've found to the higgs boson, asks a journalist? it's as if, he explains, you think you see your best friend- but is it your best friend or your best friend's twin? basically: more work is needed. he concluded: 10.54am: we're asking commenters to help us explain the higgs boson. my colleague hannah waldram has passed me on these interesting contributions: muscleguy: it's like there has been a figure in black in the ballet that the other dancers can see so dance around and with but we can't see. we see the shape of the ballet but cannot, until now see all the dancers. richardacre: it's like zoologists trying to determine if they've discovered a new species of butterfly by looking at a meadow through binoculars. from 16 miles away. our very own shiv malik has also put his scientist's hat on to try to explain one talking point is how reliable the results are. this is based on how certain physicists are about the data they have. the way this is normally measured is through standard deviation i.e. the 1-5 sigma that we've been hearing about. handy explainer graphically shows what deviation is on a usual distribution graph or a bell curve, where most results are based around the middle but there are also some extreme results at either end. something like plotting height amongst a big population of 35 year old males would give you a bell curve graph like this. tall and short at either end but most people are say, 5 ft 8". five sigma from the standard deviation therefore means many steps away from the norm. in terms of height it would be say, adults males who are either 2ft or 7ft tall i.e. very unusual. but now reverse engineer the exercise. imagine you are looking at 7ft people and you want to know how likely it is that this is a strange result from the middle or the norm. how would you work this out? how would you come up with a number to represent this? well, looking at the data, plotting the graph, you could say that 7ft adult males represent 5 sigma deviation from the norm, so you are pretty sure that this is an odd or unusual result and therefore worth being (statistically speaking) interested about. this is what those at cern have been saying today. 11.00am: as the journalists in geneva continue to beg the cern guys for replies they can understand, here at the guardian we are can you help us break it down into even simpler terms? if you're a scientist, a teacher or a physics fan with a knack for explaining big ideas and small particles, we're imploring you to help. ? how would you explain higgs boson to a 7-year-old? ? what analogy best explains what's happening at cern? ? can it be described in 200 words? 11.09am: a bold reuters journalist just asked them to provide their own metaphors for the higgs boson. alas. "the podium is metaphorless," replied heuer. british physicist peter higgs (right) speaks with belgium physicist francois englert. photograph: fabrice coffrini/afp/getty images 11.18am: ok, that's that. the press conference is over. throughout, peter higgs refused to make any comment other than to praise the achievement and to say he was making no further comment. he obviously didn't want to hog the limelight, which will only endear him further to his new legion of twitter fans. storify of twitter jokes about the higgs boson as collated by hannah waldram. sure there are plenty more to come, so tweet your best to @guardian on #higgsjokes. 11.34am: you can now read ian sample's excellent take on this morning's announcement at length here. and, for those of who still a little in the dark, check out 11.55am: my colleagues hannah and laura have been collating some of the lovely explanations coming in in response to our plea to explain the higgs boson in a way a 7-year-old child would understand. once upon a time in a far away land, there were two rival families: fermions and bosons. fermions were famous for their peculiar half spin dance. electrons, protons and quarks were all fermions. the bosons however were into full spinning though and despised half spin. photons and gluons were bosons. it was rumored that bosons had a long lost elder brother called higgs boson who had been missing for a long long time. one day a wise old man came to the land of the feuding families. he told them they should stop quaerlling over half spin and full spin, since they all used to be the same, and that they all used to be massless. the old man said that, in the beginning of time when the universe was created, everyone was born the same, but then they were immersed in a mysterious field called the higgs field making each of them different except for photons who remained the same. he said this mysterious field was made up of the higgs boson - the long lost boson brother. the families ofcourse refused to believe all this hogwash, and so the old man set about trying to prove his story and bring the higgs boson out of his hiding place. to do this he asked for help from the scientists at cern. the family feud is coming to an end, at last. 12.03pm: the science community seems agreed: this is a big moment. but many, like heuer, are cautioning that this could be just the beginning. dr roberto trotta, lecturer in cosmology at imperial college london, has this to say, according to the science media centre. this could be just the first step towards uncovering a completely new layer of reality - the higgs might lead to the discovery of supersymmetry: the notion that for every known particle there exist a super-particle with a much larger mass. and if supersymmetry is real, then we are on our way to finally crack the mystery of the dark matter in the universe. dark matter might be 'the last highlander' of all supersymmetric particles, the only surviving 'sparticle' from the big bang. and we might be on the verge of hunting it down at the lhc. professor john womersley, stfc chief executive, said: obviously having found a new particle, there is still much, much more to do at the lhc - we need to confirm that this new particle is the reason some particles have tangible mass while others are insubstantial - as proposed by peter higgs and other scientists, who predicted that a previously unknown particle must exist for our current understanding of the universe to work. and, for professor valentin khoze, director of durham university's institute for particle physics phenomenology (ippp), this discovery is just opening the door to others that could be even more exciting. the second part of the story about the higgs particle is even more exciting as it provides us with a window to new physics - a tool for the exploration of the truly unknown. the next stage will be a detailed and careful study of its properties. successful completion of this second stage will bring us closer to uncovering new physics, explaining dark matter and other mysteries of the universe. stephen hawking bet gordy kane (umich) $100 that the higgs would never be found at cern. wonder if he's conceded defeat? 12.24pm: still full of higgs related questions? cern theorist ignatios antoniadis has had a go at answering some of the public's most pressing queries here . broken down into the main points antoniadis says: ? the newly-discovered particle looks like the higgs boson but, as its properties have not been fully studied yet, a final label will "only come after further investigations". ? the cern scientists will specifically be looking at decay rates as these, together with mass, characterise particles. the particle could either decay "with the rates expected from the standard model (sm)", or it will decay differently- which will then beg the question of whether the sm needs "small adjustments...or if new physics processes need to be looked for in order to explain its nature". (i think this would be a pretty major upset.) ? the particle, because of its low mass, has allowed the scientific community to rule out theories such as "technicolor" and "some of the theoretical models used in supersymmetry. however, other supersymmetric or not scenarios could still apply, as well as extra-dimensional theories." ? the good news for theorists is that experimentalists may be able to provide us with this information about decay rates over the next few months. 12.38pm: and if after all this you still have questions relating to the-particle-that-may-be-higgs-but-is-not-for-sure, there'll be a live q+a taking place at 1pm here. my colleague laura oliver writes: got a question about the higgs boson, cern or the large hadron collider, but been too afraid to ask? as we report live from geneva on scientists' latest efforts to find the 'god particle', two leading physics professors will be online to take your questions. from 1pm bst we will have professor stefan soldner-rembold, professor of particle physics at the school of physics and astronomy, university of manchester, and professor andy parker, professor of high energy physics at the university of cambridge, available to answer your questions about the higgs boson. 12.43pm: and some more higgs trivia (i'm not sure any of it is really trivial, but anyway) courtesy of the press association. q: what is the higgs boson and the higgs field? a: the higgs field has been described as a kind of cosmic "treacle" spread through the universe. as particles travel through the treacle they slow down, lose energy and get heavier. the higgs boson is the force-carrying particle that helps transmit the effects of the higgs field. q: what would the world be like without the higgs boson? a: according to the standard model theory, it would not be recognisable. without something to give mass to the basic building blocks of matter, everything would behave as light does, floating freely and not combining with other particles. ordinary matter, as we know it, would not exist. q: how did the higgs boson get the nickname "the god particle"? a: a nobel laureate physicist from fermilab called leon lederman wrote a book in the early 1990s about the search for the higgs boson. his publishers coined the name as a marketable title for the book, but it's disliked by many scientists. 1.27pm: my colleague mary hamilton happens to have a brother with a phd in quantum mechanics (handy, that), who has spent his lunch break emailing his thoughts on the higgs announcement and what it all means. below the line but here's his answer to the burning question: was it a standard model higgs, or something else? well, according to today's results, both detectors actually saw a bigger excess in the diphoton channel - i.e. more than would be predicted with a standard model higgs. also the tau-tau channel showed nothing at all. that could mean that this isn't a sm higgs which would be what's know in the trade as "cool new science". having said that, those discrepancies are not yet very significant ( admitted to the bbc that he's lost his bet that the higgs particle wouldn't be found (see 12.09pm ). it seems i have just lost $100. the results, said hawking, "strongly suggest" that cern had found the higgs particle. if its properties turn out to be as expected, he said, "it will be strong evidence for the so-called standard model of particle physics, the theory that explains all our experiments so far." this is an important result and should guarantee higgs the nobel prize but it is a pity in a way because the great advances in physics have come from experiments that gave results we didn't expect. been on the airwaves telling the bbc why, for him, this day is one for the history books. this is without doubt in my opinion the biggest scientific discovery of my lifetime and without doubt one of the biggest scientific discoveries of all time, so i'm tremendously excited... this day will go down as one of the great days in the history of science i think, and that's not overly hyperbolic. cox said he almost felt shocked that "such a strange thing" had been shown to be true. this is a prediction that was made almost 50 years ago. and the prediction is that the universe, everywhere, empty space, everywhere you look, every little cubic centimetre of space in front of you and inside your body and across the universe, is rammed full of higgs particles, and everything that makes up your body, the little subatomic particles in your hand, are bouncing off them, and that's how they get their mass. and more than that the theory said that these higgs particles condensed out into empty space less than a billionth of a second after the universe began. it sounds very esoteric and fundamental. but what we've shown today is that's right. that's actually how the universe works. so it's one of the central planks of our understanding of how everything in the universe works. and even though, throughout my whole career as a particle physicist of 20 years now, this theory has been there, i think the realisation that it's actually right is quite shocking, actually; i'm quite shocked that such a strange thing has been shown to be true. 2.39pm: we're going to wrap up this live blog now. thanks for all your illuminating and engaged comments; i can only apologise for my woeful inability to understand almost anything that was said by the clever people of cern. for a brilliant write-up of what today means- and, to quote him, why "the real work begins" now- have a look at ian sample's higgs boson announcement live: cern scientists discover subatomic particle 09.43 edt on wednesday 4 july 2012. it was last modified at higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle contributor open for comments. in the greatest of ironies, proof of a god particle might prove the non-existence of god. what's with the 'boffin' thing in reference to the excellent mr. (dr.? prof.?) sample? isn't the guardian normally a bit more careful with personal and professional stereotyping? of couse, i retract this comment unreservedly if he actuall yet you refer to them as god's choice ;) add that turn of phrase to the wonderfully verboten "god damn particle" and we illustrate the power of human language to skew the world. which returns us to irony! clapping for peter higgs, who has just arrived in the auditorium. when this was all starting to come to the fore a couple of years ago or whenever it was (before the machine broke down - hope it was under guarantee) it sounded exciting - they were going to be doing all this smashing up of stuff in this hi tech tunnel and i was hoping there'd be some really cool photos and videos of it all happening. i liked ian sample's video. what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? how disappointing to discover that all we're going to get is data and a probability reading of the (god?) damn thing existing. once the higgs particle is detected and experiments are repeated a few times to be sure, what then? what other particles do the higgs degrade to? do they have names? are they important? the photon is probably the most important on a day-to-day level, since exchange of photons results in the electromagnetic force, which is what prevents everything from collapsing in a heap... congratulations to the scientists. great day for them (and the rest of us). money well spent europe. none so far but the apparent mass of the higgs is consistent with ss. electrons, on the other hand, do not appear to be composite - but they might be on scales smaller than those we can currently probe. observer1951: the universe we see is made of of energetically stable (relative to the lifespan of the universe) particles. the higgs particle is hugely unstable because it's so energetic. we have to put an awful lot of energy into one place in order to produce it; then fractions of a second later, the universe notices that we've piled a lot up and it avalanches down as other, more stable particles / portions of energy. it's these particles we can see and we work backwards to deduce where they came from. so if the higgs particle is unstable, the field isn't - particles don't actually have to really exist for them to have an effect - the quantum foam (at the smallest possible distance in the universe, the planck length) is popping particles in and out all the time, they're not really there, but things don't add up unless we take them into account. the higgs boson is unstable because it is energetically favourable for it to decay to something else. the higgs field is different thing from the particle - you could say the higgs boson is the physical manifestation of the field, and there is no problem with a stable field resulting in an unstable particle. quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

T	'god particle' a gateway to new vision of universe
C	enlarge a graphic from the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in geneva shows a proton-proton collision event measured in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experience in the search for the higgs boson. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries including dark matter. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries including dark matter. the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) unveiled data from the large hadron collider on wednesday "consistent with the long-sought higgs boson", an elusive particle thought to help explain why matter has mass. it was hailed as a huge moment for science by physicists gathered in australia, where cern's findings were unveiled via videolink from geneva at a landmark conference attended by hundreds of the field's top experts. scientists went into a frenzy following the announcement, speculating that it could one day make light speed travel possible by "un-massing" objects or allow huge items to be launched into space by "switching off" the higgs. cern scientist albert de roeck likened it to the discovery of electricity, when he said humanity could never have imagined its future applications. "what's really important for the higgs is that it explains how the world could be the way that it is in the first millionth of a second in the big bang," de roeck told afp. "can we apply it to something? at this moment my imagination is too small to do that." physicist ray volkas said "almost everybody" was hoping that, rather than fitting the so-called standard model of physics -- a theory explaining how particles fit together in the universe -- the higgs boson would prove to be "something a bit different". "if that was the case that would point to all sorts of new physics, physics that might have something to do with dark matter," he said, referring to the hypothetical invisible matter thought to make up much of the universe. enlarge british physicist peter higgs smiles at a press conference on july 4, at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) offices in meyrin near geneva. after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists said on july 4 they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. "it could be, for example, that the higgs particle acts as a bridge between ordinary matter, which makes up atoms, and dark matter, which we know is a very important component of the universe." "that would have really fantastic implications for understanding all of the matter in the universe, not just ordinary atoms," he added. de roeck said scrutinising the new particle and determining whether it supported something other than the standard model would be the next step for cern scientists. clarification could be expected by the beginning of 2013; definitive proof that it fitted the standard model could take until 2015 when the lhc had more power and could harvest more data. the lhc is due to go offline for a two-year refit in december that will see its firepower doubled to 14 trillion electronvolts -- a huge step forward in the search for new particles and clues about what holds them all together. de roeck said he would find it a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the standard model higgs". instead, he was hoping it would be a "gateway or a portal to new physics , to new theories which are actually running nature" such as supersymmetry, which hypothesises that there are five different higgs particles governing mass. the hunt for higgs -- the logical next step of which de roeck said would be searching for, and eventually being able to produce, dark matter particles -- has already had huge benefits to medicine and technology. volkas said the internet was born at cern as a solution to high-volume data-sharing and other major spin-offs were likely to follow as physicists continued to "push the boundaries of pure science". enlarge participants take a rest early on july 4, before the opening of a seminar on the latest update in the 50-year search for the higgs boson pareticle at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) near geneva. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the "god particle" was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries "we just want to know how the world works, but in order to answer those questions you have to develop new technologies," he said. funding for particle physics is already under scrutiny in north america, where the lhc's predecessor, the illinois-based tevatron run by fermilab, was closed late last year due to financial constraints. fermilab director pier oddone said money was a "big, big issue" threatening progress in the united states and he hoped the higgs discovery would spur greater funding from us agencies and congress. "what i would hope is that this excitement, this focus of the world's attention on this discovery, will actually help a lot in stimulating and reestablishing particle physics in north america," oddone said. de roeck said there were similar problems in europe, where physicists will meet in september to discuss research priorities for the next 20 years and whether they need and can afford an accelerator after the lhc. "that is going to be a tough fight," he said. "despite this momentous moment we have now, it doesn't necessarily bring the funding which one would require." he urged governments and other key contributors to see fundamental science as a "must" rather than a luxury. "this is the only way we can actually move on and have a deeper understanding of how things work. it can only be in our benefit exploring that."

T	hines farm blog: physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe - nytimes.com
C	go to full article scientists in geneva on wednesday applauded the discovery of a subatomic particle that looks like the higgs boson. pool photo by denis balibouse by dennis overbye july4, 2012 aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data presented in graphs with bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti noted that the mass of the putative higgs, apparently one of the heaviest subatomic particles, made it easy to study its many behaviors. "thanks, nature," she said. gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause, like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime," he said. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented what came to be known as the higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and fran?ois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough with the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen possible ways, depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not describe how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find, eluding researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare in abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the "goddamn particle.") finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly. so far, the physicists admit, they know little about their new boson. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the boson while others might be underproducing it, clues that maybe there is more at work here than the standard model would predict. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said guido tonelli of cern. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team of physicists, said: "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins."

C	e-mail published july 05, 2012, 06:58 am scientists discover 'the god particle' researchers announce new subatomic particle is 'at the center of everything.' a half-century scientific quest culminated early wednesday as physicists announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle - one theorized to be so fundamental that without it, nothing could exist. dubbed the higgs boson - or the "god particle," to the chagrin of scientists - the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the universe, imbuing everything that we can see and touch with the fundamental property known as mass. "as a layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern, the european organization for nuclear research, immediately after physicists presented compelling evidence for the new particle at a seminar in geneva. "do you agree?" he asked the several hundred scientists packing cern's main auditorium. applause broke out. the video feed from cern showed peter higgs, the university of edinburgh physicist who theorized the existence of this exotic particle in 1964, tearing up. "we have a discovery," said heuer. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood, applauded and cheered for a full minute. "i have the impression you are all happy," said heuer. moments later, higgs stood and said, "for me, it's really an incredible thing that happened in my lifetime." while there were typical scientist-esque notes of caution - a cern statement called the discovery "preliminary" - scientists around the world celebrated the moment. a video feed from melbourne, australia, where an international physics conference is set to begin, showed an auditorium packed with cheering scientists. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. at fermilab, long-time home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, some 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," said lincoln. "people were riveted. discovery is what scientists live for." at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared a bottle of champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts, one of the more than 6,000 scientists who contributed to the discovery. "i'm still astonished that at 3 a.m. on the fourth of july you can gather" so many people excited about the arcane field of subatomic physics, tuts said. high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and professors all shared the bubbly after the discovery became clear. "we toasted this," said tuts. "it was great fun to see the culmination of years and years of work." with a self-imposed deadline of july 4 - set two years ago to line up with the conference in melbourne - cern physicists raced in recent days to collect and analyze enough data to say they had, indeed, found a new particle that looked like the long-sought higgs. as late as tuesday, two teams pored over results from the last run of high-energy subatomic collisions at the huge large hadron collider straddling the french-swiss border. "it's the last month of running that did it," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments at cern that found evidence of the higgs, during his presentation wednesday morning. the discovery of the new particle completes what's known as the standard model of particle physics, the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found - and the higgs was the last holdout, and the most important. that's because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," said lykken. "this is why [nobel prize-winning physicist] leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more massive objects get tangled up in the field - and hence, slowed down as they move - more than less massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. the cern physicists did not see this new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of millions of high-energy subatomic collisions and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of criss-crossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. two independent teams, working on two separate particle detectors, arrived at similar results - a kind of cross-check. the two teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not to share their results with each other before the seminar at cern wednesday. to find this tiny particle, scientists built the biggest of machines - a 17-mile ring under the french-swiss border called the large hadron collider (lhc). at two points along the ring, they installed cathedral-sized detectors that capture traces of high-energy collisions of protons. inside this subatomic wreckage, both detectors saw evidence for a subatomic particle with a mass of around 125 giga-electron volts - or about 125 times the mass of a proton. cern announced last december that it was homing in on the higgs, but cautioned that it needed a new batch of high-energy collisions to gain confidence that scientists were seeing something real and not a random bump in the data. the hunt for the higgs represented a test for theorists and, at a more nuts-and-bolts level, for the public officials who decided to green-light the extraordinarily elaborate and tricky endeavor to find a hypothetical particle. an explosion in one of the lhc's sensitive superconducting magnets in september 2008 delayed operations for more than year. but this biggest of big science experiments now appears to have paid off. columbia university physicist brian greene, speaking prior to the announcement, said, "everything i've ever done, directly or indirectly, has something to do with a higgs-like field." the discovery of the higgs is the latest reminder that the universe can be understood through mathematics. "it makes you feel good as a theorist," greene said. "math really does provide a window on reality!"

C	british physicist peter higgs, right, speaks with belgium physicist francois englert at a press conference on july 4, 2012 at european organization for nuclear research (cern) offices in meyrin near geneva. princeton - for the new jersey scientists involved in what could be one of the biggest scientific discoveries in history, the party started at 3 a.m. wednesday with bottles of champagne and higgs boson sugar cookies. dozens of local physicists, researchers, theorists and students quietly gathered for an early morning soiree in princeton. the group watched a live feed from switzerland where scientists announced they believe they have detected the higgs boson, one of the building blocks of the universe. most in the room, including teams of rutgers and princeton physicists who had worked on the project, knew for weeks the announcement was coming. but they wanted to gather to be part of history. "this is something that we've been waiting for - the field has been waiting for - for at least 20 years," said amit lath, a rutgers associate professor of physics who contributed to the project. "you knew you had to be there." the group gathered at the institute for advanced study, the independent research center located in princeton that had once been the academic home of albert einstein. though it was early in the morning, those who attended the higgs boson party said they were wide awake as they watched the lengthy scientific explanation from the cern particle-physics center near geneva that concluded with the announcement of the landmark discovery. "it was basically dead silence for two hours until the applause started," said scott thomas, a rutgers physics professor who contributed to the discovery. "it was too exciting to sleep." along with champagne, the new jersey group noshed on homemade iced sugar cookies decorated with a greek letter meant to represent the higgs boson particle. fabrice coffrini/afp/gettyimages a picture with a zoom effect show a graphic traces of proton-proton collisions events measured by european organization for nuclear research (cern) in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experience on may 25, 2011 in the search for the higgs boson. the rutgers and princeton scientists were among several thousand physicists who contributed to the higgs discovery by analyzing trillions of proton-proton collisions performed at the large hadron collider on the border of switzerland and france. the researchers were divided into two teams, called atlas and cms. the rutgers and princeton physicists were both part of the cms team. rutgers officials said their group, which includes a half dozen professors assisted by numerous students and researchers over the years, has been contributing to the project since 1995. rutgers helped lead the effort to build the silicon pixel detector at the heart of the higgs boson discovery, campus officials said. rutgers professors also helped analyze the data and lead groups of scientists exploring the theories behind the discovery. at princeton university, about 15 researchers contributed to the project, campus officials said. the university's physicists were responsible for determining luminosity, one of the key measures that helped researchers calculate how many elusive particles they should expect to see in their experiments. the search for the higgs boson is far from over, according to those working on the project. they plan to continue their research to confirm they have really found the higgs boson or if the discovery will lead to new fields of research. "the higgs mechanism is really a window into a whole set of physics that we have yet to explore," daniel marlow, a princeton physics professor who worked on the project, said in a statement. related coverage: ? physicists nearly prove existence of 'god particle'

T	'god particle' discovery may help better explain building blocks of universe | nj.com
C	epa/martial trezzini a 2007 file photo showing showing the magnet core of the world's largest superconducting solenoid magnet (cms, compact muon solenoid), one of the experiments preparing to take data at european organization for nuclear research (cern)'s large hadron collider (lhc) particle accelerator, in geneva. geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." british physicist peter higgs, right, speaks with belgium physicist francois englert at a press conference on july 4, 2012 at european organization for nuclear research (cern) offices in meyrin near geneva. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. fabrice coffrini/afp/gettyimages a picture with a zoom effect show a graphic traces of proton-proton collisions events measured by european organization for nuclear research (cern) in the compact muon solenoid (cms) experience on may 25, 2011 in the search for the higgs boson. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries." related coverage: ? n.j. scientists gather to watch announcement of major physics discovery ? physicists nearly prove existence of 'god particle'

C	after more than 30 years of planning, building and testing, the large hadron collider is providing answers that could fundamentally change the way in which we understand the universe. cern, the european organisation for nuclear research, has revealed its preliminary data analysis today at the site of the collider in geneva - with the revelation that a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the elusive higgs boson has been discovered. named after its inceptor, professor peter higgs, the boson may provide an answer to the long standing mystery of why objects have mass. as the momentous news was announced this morning professor higgs shed tears of joy. he said in a statement: "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." but how did research undertaken decades ago by a british professor culminate in the announcement of the so called "god particle"? building blocks after completing a degree and masters in physics, newcastle-born peter higgs moved to edinburgh in 1960 to take up lectureship and continue his research. four years later he arrived at a breakthrough, proposing the existence of a subatomic particle that could explain how mass works. professor higgs said that the finding did not come to him in a 'eureka' moment, but instead it was one that fermented over a period of time. professor peter higgs' work inspired cern's ?6bn large hadron collider. "by the summer of 1964 i knew i was on to something," he told der spiegel. "that was perhaps the reason, because my head was full of thoughts, that i forgot the instructions for putting up the tent when we went for a camping trip in the scottish mountains". after returning to the university of edinburgh, professor higgs wrote his seminal paper "broken symmetries and the masses of gauge bosons", published in 'physical review letters'. as it turned out, professor higgs was not the only physicist to propose such a theory. a paper written by robert brout and francois englert ["broken symmetry and the mass of gauge vector mesons"] and another authored by gerald guralnik, c. richard hagen and tom kibble ["global conservation laws and massless particles"] touched upon the same principles - all three theories paving the way for the ambitious work at the large hadron collider at cern. put into practice oddly enough, professor higgs' landmark work almost never saw the light of day as it was initially rejected by the editor of 'physics letters', who failed to see its importance. higgs tinkered with his exposition and sent the piece to 'physical review letters', who published it later that year. despite a mass of intrigue surrounding the work of higgs and his contemporaries, it was not until 1976 that cern's professor john ellis hinted that the research should be put to the test. what followed was 36 years of conception and construction of the large hadron collider- a ?6bn project to find the elusive higgs boson. the world's largest atom smasher, the large hadron collider. built beneath the swiss/french border at geneva, the mammoth collider extends more than 16.5m in a circular tunnel - a complex system which took a decade to build. since its initiation in 2008, the collider has encountered a number of technical problems, but physicists captured a hint of the boson's existence late last year, although more data was needed for confirmation. in essence the large hadron collider was built to create the ideal conditions to produce evidence of the higgs boson. the collider contains 1200 magnets cooled to -271c, which accelerate protons to 99.9% of the speed of light. at this speed the protons then 'collide', creating thousands of new particles. physicists believe that for every billion collisions 10 higgs bosons are created, although it is a fine art to measure. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer today. he pointed out, though, that further work was needed to identify what exactly had been found. "as a layman i would say we have it, but as a scientist i have to say, 'what do we have?'" heuer told a press conference. "we have discovered a boson, and now we have to determine what kind of boson it is." finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. story laser show marks opening of the shard story m6 toll road incident 'not terrorist rel ? story people carrier smashes through building story timelapse video: shard in construction story peter higgs and the 'god particle' physics is like sex; it has practical uses, but thats not why we do it.

C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times scientists at the fermilab in batavia, ill., on wednesday watched the presentation about the discovery of the higgs boson, which was shown from geneva. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

"we've a discovery. we've observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now was a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass. it is mass that combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it. gravity existed even before newton explained it. but now scientists see something much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10-billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has for years been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorise occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said they had both "observed" a new subatomic particle, a boson. dr. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." asked whether the find is a discovery, he answered: "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?'" the leaders of the two cern teams, joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists, each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. dr. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether what has been discovered is indeed the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s. they did that as part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. "the" higgs or "a" higgs that was the question on wednesday. "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," dr. heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson, not the higgs boson." "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-km tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as dr. gianotti and dr. incandela each took their turn. dr. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle," and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" dr. gianotti said to laughs, giving credit for the discovery. later, she said that "the standard model [of physics] is not complete," but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way to explain how the subatomic universe works and got started. dr. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted, or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think of how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we've found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story... now, we're way out on the edge of exploration." end time news, facts to be known tagged as : end time news facts to be known

T	scientists confirm elusive higgs boson - oneidadispatch.com
C	joe incandela, spokesperson of the cms experiment, addresses a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin near geneva, switzerland, wednesday, july 4, 2012. the head of the world's biggest atom smasher is claiming discovery of a new particle that he says is consistent with the long-sought higgs boson known popularly as the "god particle" which is believed to give all matter in the universe size and shape. (ap photo/denis balibouse, pool) geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. see full story marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. oneida public library launching zombie scavanger hunt scientists confirm elusive higgs boson i've had second thoughts on my animal charity column 8 named to all-state baseball team (12) homemade father's day gifts june 15 at morrisville public library bath salts blamed for oneida crash (3) oneida healthcare renovations complete oneida teen missionary heading to secret country in asia man commits suicide in nys fair parking lot community news ? copyright 2012 the oneida daily dispatch

T	scientists' search for higgs boson yields new subatomic particle - the washington post
C	scientists' search for higgs boson yields new subatomic particle it was the biggest of big science, a $10 billion effort involving 6,000 researchers, a 17-mile circular tunnel deep beneath the border of france and switzerland, thousands of torpedo-size magnets capable of bending beams of subatomic matter, and trillions of subatomic collisions - all in the quest for a momentary hint, the slightest residual footprint, of an elusive particle called the higgs boson. and it worked. wednesday's announcement by scientists in europe that they'd found the higgs boson, or something remarkably higgs-like, was a stunning triumph of both theory and experiment. peter higgs, a theorist who envisioned the particle as a young man in 1964, teared up as he attended the discovery announcement in geneva. "it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," higgs, 83, said when he took the microphone before a packed auditorium at cern, the european organization for nuclear research, which operates the higgs-hunting large hadron collider . the higgs - famously dubbed "the god particle," to the chagrin of scientists - is so fundamental to the universe that, in its absence, nothing could exist. the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the cosmos and imbues other particles with the property known as mass - the resistance to being shoved around. actively hunted since the 1970s, the higgs is the final major piece of the standard model, which for physics is the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. "to the layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern . "do you agree?" he asked the crowd. applause broke out. "we have a discovery," heuer said. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood and cheered for a full minute. the geneva announcement was a global event, observed in every time zone. scientists gathered at 3 a.m. eastern in universities and laboratories across the united states to watch the webcast. as late as tuesday afternoon, the leaders of the search weren't sure whether they could announce an actual "discovery" of a new particle or whether they would have to fudge their language, deferring to strict notions of scientific certainty. but after a final run of the data, officials concluded that two detectors, named atlas and cms, and operated by separate scientific teams, had met the standard for proving that the particle was real and not an experimental quirk. what remains unknown is whether the new particle is the theorized higgs of the standard model, or is merely "higgs-like." important properties of the particle remain unclear, such as whether it spins, and whether it interacts with other particles in the expected manner of the theorized higgs. regardless of whether it's the higgs or a higgs imposter, it's a very real particle, and newly known to science, and apparently fundamental to the texture of the universe. "having written my first paper on how and where to look for the higgs boson back in 1975, this is certainly a big day!" said cern theorist john ellis, who celebrated with champagne at a private gathering at his home with peter higgs the night before the announcement. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered." "it looks like a higgs; it quacks like a higgs; but we need dna tests (more data) to make sure it is the higgs," michael turner, a university of chicago physicist who watched the announcement at a gathering of physicists in aspen, colo., said by e-mail. "for now, it is time to celebrate a little and spike the ball in the end zone." the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found. the higgs was the final holdout. it was also the most important, because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. "this is why [nobel prize-winning physicist] leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more-massive objects get tangled up in the field more than less-massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. a photon, which is a light particle, has no mass because it zips through the higgs ocean without interacting with it. light speed is the cosmic speed limit for this reason - because nothing can have less-than-zero interaction with the higgs field. (mass can then be described as the quality that keeps everything from moving at the speed of light.) a neutrino has an extremely small mass - it moves at nearly the speed of light (and not faster, as some european scientists suggested last year erroneously before finding that a loose cable was the culprit for their weird results). ordinary matter that makes up the bulk of stars, planets and human beings is relatively massive. the most massive particles move like someone trying to walk through neck-high water. the cern physicists did not see the new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of trillions of high-energy subatomic collisions, and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of crisscrossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. the two independent teams from the atlas and cms experiments served as cross-checks for each other. the teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not to share their results before the seminar wednesday at cern. the large hadron collider creates beams of particles that move in opposite directions and then collide inside cathedral-size detectors that are parked in vast caverns along the tunnel. the detectors capture traces of the collisions. inside this subatomic wreckage, both detectors saw evidence of a subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 giga-electron volts - or about 125 times the mass of a proton. cern announced in december that it was homing in on the higgs but cautioned that it needed a new batch of high-energy collisions to gain confidence that scientists were seeing something real and not a random bump in the data. months of collisions pushed the data into the discovery zone. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," lykken said. columbia university physicist brian greene, speaking before the announcement, said, "everything i've ever done, directly or indirectly, has something to do with a higgs-like field." the discovery of the higgs is the latest reminder, he said, that the universe can be understood through mathematics. "it makes you feel good as a theorist," greene said. "math really does provide a window on reality!" at fermilab, longtime home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, about 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," lincoln said. "people were riveted." at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts. "it was great fun to see the culmination of years and years of work," tuts said. the discovery hardly ends the quest to understand the essence of space, time, energy and matter. among the remaining mysteries are dark matter, the unknown substance observed only through its gravitational effects, and dark energy, a cosmic force that seems to be causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.

T	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe - siliconvalley.com
C	aspen, colo. -- signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider, the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's advertisement something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist at uc santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data wednesday. at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond -- everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws -- but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory -- and there are hints of some already -- could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story -- more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and only began operating two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of some 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the past two years. copyright 2012 san jose mercury news. all rights reserved.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle ? national, international news ? valdosta daily times
C	geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries."

C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times scientists at the fermilab in batavia, ill., on wednesday watched the presentation about the discovery of the higgs boson, which was shown from geneva. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

T	kresta in the afternoon: "it's a boson:" higgs quest bears new particle
C	( reuters ) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists assembled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. "nobel prizes all round." higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. end of an era "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon, associated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the "celebrity" of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. "that is what we are sure is the higgs," a cern scientist said. less than one in a million "it's a boson!" headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the "dramatic 5 sigma signal" for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. "the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful," oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. "we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted." "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: "cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson," he said. "in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: "we have closed one chapter and opened another," said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: "this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made." higgs himself called it a great achievement for cern's collider. without it, his ideas would remain just a paper theory and he conceded that he personally was never cut out for laboratory experimentation: "i certainly did some lab work as a schoolboy in bristol," he told reuters. "i was incompetent."

Q	dramatic 5 sigma signal
Q	the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful,
Q	we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted.
Q	if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs.
Q	cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson,
Q	in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs.
Q	we have closed one chapter and opened another,
Q	this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made.
Q	i certainly did some lab work as a schoolboy in bristol,
Q	i was incompetent.

T	a closer look at the higgs boson | news | ecn magazine
C	frank jordans, the associated press get today's electronic oem design headlines and news - sign up now! berlin (ap) -- scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. advantage business media ? copyright 2012 advantage business media you may login with either your assigned username or your e-mail address.

T	tracy's astro salon: neptune in pisces: higgs boson
C	back in february neptune officially moved into pisces where it will remain until 2025. one of the expectations with neptune in its home sign is breakthroughs in the arts, spiritually and science since all fall into the dreamy 'world-within-world' nature of pisces. this week a perfect example of one of those breakthroughs was announced in switzerland. physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe by dennis overbye aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. link this is just the beginning of the transit, a lot more to come in the next 13 years.

T	the durango herald 07/05/2012 | eureka! physicists celebrate new subatomic particle find
C	eureka! physicists celebrate new subatomic particle find eureka! physicists celebrate new subatomic particle find higgs boson said to reveal secrets of matter and mass geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular17-mile underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. this image made available by cern shows a typical candidate event of a higgs boson. to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson - popularly known as the "god particle" - that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and mass.

T	editors weblog - what we have really learned from the coverage of higgs boson
C	as you are very nearly certain to have read, physicists at cern, the european center for nuclear research in geneva, made a brain-bending announcement yesterday: the higgs boson, or at least a "higgslike" subatomic particle, is very nearly certain to exist. what on (or beyond) earth does that mean? the internet is awash with explanations, so many of us are probably nearly certain to have a pretty good idea. but in the grand tradition of high school science class, let's double-check with a pop quiz: c. a particle the standard model is? a. a theory of particle physics now proven to be electromagnetic hogwash, thanks to the discovery of the "higgslike" particle yesterday b. regarded by some as a theory of almost everything, that describes all of the matter that we can see in the universe (including ourselves) c. a car with a clutch why is the higgs boson often referred to as the god particle? a. because it proves his existence, debunking evolution once and for all b. because the editor of nobel laureate leon lederman would not let him call it the goddamn particle, and because of a connection to genesis 11: 1-9 c. because it sounds sexier in a headline than higgs boson answers: 1- c (a subatomic particle named after scientist s.n. bose); 2-b and sometimes c; 3-somewhere between b and c. one certain consequence of the higgs boson announcement was that journalists the world over performed linguistic gymnastics yesterday as they grappled with one of the major challenges of their profession: wrestling a gigantic concept into graspable sentences, and then crafting those sentences into articles that people actually want to read. the internet allows for specialization, simplifying this task. it is no longer necessary for science desks the world over to serve as the sole conveyors of such a weighty matter (sorry) within their communities; those who do not have enough experience in writing about science can comfortably delegate the task to experts. however, the internet's "look at me!" culture may also exacerbate the risk of falling into traps such as sensationalism and hyperbole. in this case, as poynter's al tompkins points out, the primary traps were an over-reliance on divine references ("god particle" being nothing more than an unfortunate nickname that stuck), or an over-emphasis on the magnitude of the "discovery" ("this announcement has been more like a decades-long oozing of understanding that has picked up speed in recent months," tompkins clarifies). the keys to covering big, complex issues are to be familiar with, and be transparent about, your storytelling strengths, and to use them to your advantage. here are five very different examples of higgs boson coverage that, for different reasons, worked: guardian's jon butterworth is well versed in physics. his article was prefaced with a tantalizing teaser: "inventing a whole-universe-filling-field to make your maths come out right is quite extreme. but it looks like it might just have worked." to infuse his short piece with big-picture clarity and insider appeal (while avoiding hyperbole or misleading references to an almighty force), butterworth mixed three ingredients: agility with the subject-matter: a physics professor at university college london and a member of the high energy physics group on the atlas experiment at cer, butterworth has no fear of science. as such, he was able to eschew jargon as only a true expert can. he also began his piece with a shakily scribbled replica of "a higgs boson decaying to two photons via a quantum loop." bluntness: according to butterworth, the higgs boson "had to turn up, or our understanding of fundamental physics was incomplete. well, let's be frank, wrong." genuine amazement: "today we saw a completely objective, repeatable, observation of something fundamentally new," he wrote, adding: "say that again. twice." as a reward for his earnest excitement, one commentator (a fellow scientist) obeyed. new york times, dennis overbye 's magic was in his use of metaphor: example 1: "like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in 'lawrence of arabia,' the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart." example 2: "according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous." ?with a special mention for the clearest description of the meaning of god: "to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the 'god particle,' in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the 'goddamn particle.')" irish times' science editor dick ahlstrom did not pretend that he was going to tell us what went on inside the large hadron collider, nor was his prose style particularly alluring. his strength was rather in offering a transparent, blow-by-blow account of the scientific conference at cern, allowing readers to feel like they were there: he set the scene: "the 300 seats available in the theatre were available on a first come basis for the 9am start, but by 6.30am the queue was already too big... thousands such as myself relied on a live web feed to keep tabs on the event." he used the vibrations of the scientists to establish the stakes: "it was a scientific conference like none i had ever seen; speakers so full of nervous anticipation that their voices trembled, the hushed silence of an audience hanging on every word." he transparently breezed past the science: "the presentations were almost unintelligible for non-scientists." he dispelled confusion surrounding the degree of certainty by differentiating between the way rolf heuer , cern's director general, spoke to his fellow scientists, and the way he spoke to the press: "heuer again took the floor, declaring to the meeting: 'as a layman i would say i think we have it. would you agree?'" and then, describing a shift of attitude in the press conference that followed: "heuer was determined to dampen down claims of a higgs boson." in short, ahlstrom managed to convey to the non-scientific reader the magnitude of the experiment's results and the margin for error without bogging him or her down in details that should really be acquired elsewhere on the internet, if at all. 4. in practiced blogger style, boingboing 's roundup of the best of what was out there yesterday, and humour, rounding up a selection of tweets that parodied the particle. some examples: ed casey @ edcasey :"whoa whoa whoa! we're cross-breeding hogs and bison now? thanks a lot obamacare!" # boson walks into a catholic church. priest says "what are you doing here?" hb says "you can't have mass without me" # higgsjokes guardian style guide @ guardianstyle : "overheard on the newsdesk: "i don't care what the higgs boson headline is, just make sure we spell hadron correctly." the verge, sam byford generated a flurry of twitter activity, (including a reference in the above-mentioned list of tweets) by ignoring the findings altogether, and instead concentrating on a completely different con cern (sorry): "for many of us, the most shocking revelation to come out of cern's higgs boson announcement today was quite unrelated to the science itself. rather, we were blown away by the fact that a team made up of some of the most undoubtedly brilliant people in the world believe that comic sans is an appropriate font for such a historic occasion." to conclude, as an addendum for those who have little recollection of high school physics but are left thirsty for more information about what just happened, here is a cartoon in which two scientists and a nasa-approved cartoon describe the higgs boson. the very loud prelude shows what looks like the cern cafeteria, with a strong visual emphasis on fried potatoes. the world editors forum is the organization within the world association of newspapers devoted to newspaper editors worldwide. the editors weblog ( www.editorsweblog.org ), launched in january 2004, is a wef initiative designed to facilitate the diffusion of information relevant to newspapers and their editors.

C	geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 17-mile underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ? now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added.

C	space news > higgs boson gateway to new vision of universe higgs boson gateway to new vision of universe the higgs boson could explain how our universe came to be in its first moments. understanding how the higgs boson works could be the gateway to faster-than-light travel and other fantastic science. the confirmation of the higgs boson is a gateway to a new world of physics and answer to how nature ticks. enlarge peter higgs, the scottish physicist who proposed the existence of such a particle in 1964, attends a press conference in geneva, switzerland, july 4, 2012. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the higgs boson was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries, including dark matter. the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) unveiled data from the large hadron collider on wednesday "consistent with the long-sought higgs boson", an elusive particle thought to help explain why matter has mass. it was hailed as a huge moment for science by physicists gathered in australia, where cern's findings were unveiled via videolink from geneva at a landmark conference attended by hundreds of the field's top experts. scientists went into a frenzy following the announcement, speculating that it could one day make light speed travel possible by "un-massing" objects or allow huge items to be launched into space by "switching off" the higgs. cern scientist albert de roeck likened it to the discovery of electricity, when he said humanity could never have imagined its future applications. "what's really important for the higgs is that it explains how the world could be the way that it is in the first millionth of a second in the big bang," de roeck told afp. "can we apply it to something? at this moment my imagination is too small to do that." physicist ray volkas said "almost everybody" was hoping that, rather than fitting the so-called standard model of physics -- a theory explaining how particles fit together in the universe -- the higgs boson would prove to be "something a bit different". "if that was the case that would point to all sorts of new physics, physics that might have something to do with dark matter," he said, referring to the hypothetical matter some suggest makes up most of the mass in the universe. "it could be, for example, that the higgs particle acts as a bridge between ordinary matter, which makes up atoms, and dark matter, which we know is a very important component of the universe." watch video: what is the large hadron collider? "that would have really fantastic implications for understanding all of the matter in the universe, not just ordinary atoms," he added. de roeck said scrutinizing the new particle and determining whether it supported something other than the standard model would be the next step for cern scientists. clarification could be expected by the beginning of 2013; definitive proof that it fitted the standard model could take until 2015 when the large hadron collider (lhc) had more power and could harvest more data. de roeck said he would find it a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the standard model higgs". instead, he was hoping it would be a "gateway or a portal to new physics, to new theories which are actually running nature" such as supersymmetry, which hypothesizes that there are five different higgs particles governing mass. the search for higgs -- the logical next step of which de roeck said would be searching for, and eventually being able to produce, dark matter particles -- has already had huge benefits to medicine and technology. volkas said the internet was born at cern as a solution to high-volume data-sharing and other major spin-offs were likely to follow as physicists continued to "push the boundaries of pure science". "we just want to know how the world works, but in order to answer those questions you have to develop new technologies," he said. funding for particle physics is already under scrutiny in north america, where the lhc's predecessor, the tevatron, was closed late last year due to financial constraints. de roeck said there were similar problems in europe, where physicists will meet in september to discuss research priorities for the next 20 years and whether they need and can afford an accelerator after the lhc. "that is going to be a tough fight," he said. "despite this momentous moment we have now, it doesn't necessarily bring the funding which one would require." he urged governments and other key contributors to see fundamental science as a "must" rather than a luxury.

T	higgs boson gateway to new vision of universe : discovery news
C	space news > higgs boson gateway to new vision of universe higgs boson gateway to new vision of universe the higgs boson could explain how our universe came to be in its first moments. understanding how the higgs boson works could be the gateway to faster-than-light travel and other fantastic science. the confirmation of the higgs boson is a gateway to a new world of physics and answer to how nature ticks. enlarge peter higgs, the scottish physicist who proposed the existence of such a particle in 1964, attends a press conference in geneva, switzerland, july 4, 2012. physicists said thursday the potential discovery of the higgs boson was a gateway to a new era that could see humanity unlock some of the universe's great mysteries, including dark matter. the european organisation for nuclear research (cern) unveiled data from the large hadron collider on wednesday "consistent with the long-sought higgs boson", an elusive particle thought to help explain why matter has mass. it was hailed as a huge moment for science by physicists gathered in australia, where cern's findings were unveiled via videolink from geneva at a landmark conference attended by hundreds of the field's top experts. scientists went into a frenzy following the announcement, speculating that it could one day make light speed travel possible by "un-massing" objects or allow huge items to be launched into space by "switching off" the higgs. cern scientist albert de roeck likened it to the discovery of electricity, when he said humanity could never have imagined its future applications. "what's really important for the higgs is that it explains how the world could be the way that it is in the first millionth of a second in the big bang," de roeck told afp. "can we apply it to something? at this moment my imagination is too small to do that." physicist ray volkas said "almost everybody" was hoping that, rather than fitting the so-called standard model of physics -- a theory explaining how particles fit together in the universe -- the higgs boson would prove to be "something a bit different". "if that was the case that would point to all sorts of new physics, physics that might have something to do with dark matter," he said, referring to the hypothetical matter some suggest makes up most of the mass in the universe. "it could be, for example, that the higgs particle acts as a bridge between ordinary matter, which makes up atoms, and dark matter, which we know is a very important component of the universe." watch video: what is the large hadron collider? "that would have really fantastic implications for understanding all of the matter in the universe, not just ordinary atoms," he added. de roeck said scrutinizing the new particle and determining whether it supported something other than the standard model would be the next step for cern scientists. clarification could be expected by the beginning of 2013; definitive proof that it fitted the standard model could take until 2015 when the large hadron collider (lhc) had more power and could harvest more data. de roeck said he would find it a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the standard model higgs". instead, he was hoping it would be a "gateway or a portal to new physics, to new theories which are actually running nature" such as supersymmetry, which hypothesizes that there are five different higgs particles governing mass. the search for higgs -- the logical next step of which de roeck said would be searching for, and eventually being able to produce, dark matter particles -- has already had huge benefits to medicine and technology. volkas said the internet was born at cern as a solution to high-volume data-sharing and other major spin-offs were likely to follow as physicists continued to "push the boundaries of pure science". "we just want to know how the world works, but in order to answer those questions you have to develop new technologies," he said. funding for particle physics is already under scrutiny in north america, where the lhc's predecessor, the tevatron, was closed late last year due to financial constraints. de roeck said there were similar problems in europe, where physicists will meet in september to discuss research priorities for the next 20 years and whether they need and can afford an accelerator after the lhc. "that is going to be a tough fight," he said. "despite this momentous moment we have now, it doesn't necessarily bring the funding which one would require." he urged governments and other key contributors to see fundamental science as a "must" rather than a luxury.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle' | the austin daily herald
C	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle' geneva - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ? now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible.

"it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. "this is so far out on a limb, i have no idea where it will be applied," he added. "we're talking about something we have no idea what the implications are and may not be directly applied for centuries."

T	god particle is no longer theoretical: voice of russia
C	thousands of physicists are on teams all working toward one goal by utilizing the large hadron collider at cern (the european organization for nuclear research). strong evidence points to the high probability that the higgs boson , also been nicknamed the god particle is real. why it's called the god particle is easy to understand from the get go. "because everyone was looking for it and no one was finding it," said wesley h. smith, who is a physics professor at the university of wisconsin-madison as well as a researcher on the cern project to find the higgs boson. this precise particle is said to have the answers we are looking for about essential information connected to the universe and how it was constructed. theoretically, this particle has been on physicists' minds since 1964, when the concept of it had been introduced into the scientific community. "it gives mass to everything, without it we wouldn't have any mass, the universe wouldn't exist, in a way we exist because of this higgs field," said smith. it is important though to point out that the theory of the higgs field depends on the existence of thehiggs boson. essentially, the findings indicate that the higgs boson has no spin, and is very heavy. what this means is all of its current characteristics point to it being the higgs boson, even though it is not one hundred percent confirmed. this small discovery though is just the first step forward. many physicists believe that with continuous testing until the end of 2012, they will be able to confirm without a doubt that this is the higgs boson, but only more testing, data and some patience will give the public the real answer. sau lan wu, another physics professor at the university of wisconsin-madison and the leader of the first american team to work on atlas, a cern project, said the discovery of the higgs boson will shed light on the fundamental laws of nature. if finding the higgs boson is right around the corner, then even more unimaginable discoveries may come to light. future findings may help societies worldwide develop their technology, especially when it comes to medicine. this is just a prediction however, in the coming years more research will be done surrounding the possible presence of the higgs boson, along with its behavior and characteristics.

C	$1.8 million in past due court cases click for database of past due court cases for the justice of the peace districts. click for database of monthly rainfall amounts going back to 1867. rolf heuer, director general of cern (european organization for nuclear research), answers a journalist's question about the scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in meyrin near geneva, switzerland, wednesday, july 4, 2012. "we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. (ap photo/keystone/martial trezzini) this 2011 image provide by cern, shows a real cms proton-proton collision in which 4 high energy electrons (green lines and red towers) are observed in a 2011 event. the event shows characteristics expected from the decay of a higgs boson but is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. to cheers and standing ovations, scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday july 4, 2012, calling it "consistent" with the long-sought higgs boson ? popularly known as the "god particle" ? that helps explain what gives all matter in the universe size and shape. (ap photo/cern) editorial use only - mandatory credit geneva (ap) scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science.first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted.

T	elusive higgs particle may no longer be hiding | duke today
C	sign up for newsletters, news feeds, social media and other news sources. here's where you find help from duke. elusive higgs particle may no longer be hiding durham, nc - duke scientists are among those around the world claiming victory on the hunt for the higgs boson. while they won't declare they've detected the higgs itself, the physicists announced july 4 that they did discover a new particle that closely resembles the higgs. "i have no hesitation of calling this a discovery of a new particle, one that looks exactly like what we need for the higgs," said duke physicist al goshaw. he uses an experiment called atlas, to hunt for the elusive particle, one of two higgs-hunting experiments at the large hadron collector outside geneva, switzerland. but like his colleagues, goshaw is careful not to overstate the results. finding the particle is important to physicists because, according to their simplest explanation of nature, called the standard model, without the higgs, the fundamental building blocks of the universe would not combine to make molecules and ordinary matter. the standard model has been repeatedly confirmed in other experiments, but finding the higgs particle, along with another particle discovered in 1993, really completes the model. the new results are the first, most convincing appearance of the higgs, which was predicted to exist in 1964. goshaw said the "biggest surprise" to both teams was that even though they work independently, they both had an "equally strong, consistent signal. that just carried the day." the results were announced at cern, where the lhc is housed, and also at the international conference on high energy physics in melbourne, australia. according to the results, the experiments, atlas and cms, each produced data showing that the new higgs-like particle had a mass of 125-126 gev, about 134 times the mass of the proton. "there's only a one in a million chance, for each experiment, that the results are an erroneous fluctuation, a statistic that typically signifies a discovery in science," goshaw said. the lhc results also align well with the july 2 findings announced from the us-based tevatron particle accelerator. even though the higgs is larger than a proton, it can be trapped and its signature is fleeting, appearing only once in a trillion collisions. despite the eruption of cheers in the lhc auditorium and "a lot of backslapping in the hallways," according to goshaw, physicists using lhc and tevatron have been careful to call the new particle the higgs particle. that's because "it remains to be seen if what has been discovered is indeed the higgs boson of the standard model," said mark kruse, another duke physicist who collaborates on the atlas experiment. he explained that the physicists "just don???t yet know" if this is the "one higgs particle" that completes the standard model, or if it is one of five higgs particles in a much more exotic description. what is "now clear" from the lhc findings is that "something new has been seen that will open up a whole new era of exploration, making this a very exciting time in particle physics," kruse said. once physicists know if this is the standard model higgs or one of many in a more complex description of nature, "we will be one step further in our quest for an understanding of what happened in the first trillionth of a second of the universe that made it what it is today," kruse said. he added that "if indeed we have found it, is by no means the end of the story, in fact in some sense it is only the beginning." ashutosh kotwal, another higgs-hunting duke physicist, said he thinks, as many others do, that "we have just seen the tip of the iceberg." he said he "hopes the plot thickens, and we see some unexpected behavior in the different higgs signatures" and that "nature throws us a curve ball."

"i think we've got it," said cern director general rolf dieter heuer. "you agree?" peter higgs, the 83-year-old theorist from the university of edinburgh in the united kingdom who predicted the boson's existence in 1964 and who was on hand for the event, said, "i'd like to thank the experimenters. i didn't think i'd see this in my lifetime." physicists still need to test whether the observed particle has precisely the properties that the standard model predicts it should, stresses john ellis, a theorist at king's college london. for example, researchers must compare the relative rates at which higgses decay into different combinations of particles, as those rates are predicted by theory. but the fact that the particle was discovered through the predicted decays in the first place suggests it cannot be too wildly different from the standard model higgs, ellis acknowledges. if it really is the higgs boson, then the discovery will fulfill a prediction made decades ago by higgs, although others developed some of the same basic ideas at roughly the same time. that would be just the latest in a handful of profound predictions made by particle physicists. for example, in 1970, theorists predicted the existence of a particle called the charm quark; two experimenters independently discovered the particle in 1974, for which they received the nobel prize in physics 2 years later. in 1968, theorists predicted the existence of the w and z bosons; in 1983, those particles were also discovered. in that case the theory behind the prediction won the nobel prize in 1979 and the discovery won it in 1984. the prediction and discovery of the higgs boson are as important as those of the w and z, says stuart raby, a theorist at ohio state university, columbus. "it's certainly on a par," he says. "it's certainly as fundamental." now that the standard model of particle physics is complete, a key question is whether new particles lie within the reach of the lhc or any higher-energy atom smasher that might come after it. physicists say that conceptual holes in the standard model strongly suggest that the theory is incomplete. for example, in the standard model, interactions between the higgs and the other particles ought to force the mass of the higgs to skyrocket to a value a trillion times larger. yet that doesn't happen. so most physicists suspect there are new particles out there that somehow counteract ballooning of the higgs mass. but will such particles have low enough masses to be discovered with any conceivable humanmade atom smasher? "there's absolutely no guarantee," says steven weinberg, a theorist at the university of texas, austin, who shared the 1979 nobel prize for the theory behind the w and the z. "my nightmare, and it's not just me, but a lot of us [in particle physics], is that the lhc discovers the higgs boson and nothing else," weinberg says. "that would be like closing a door." but most physicists say they are optimistic that, now that the lhc has discovered the higgs, other more surprising discoveries will follow. for now, the discovery of the higgs is a dream come true.
Q	i think we've got it,
Q	you agree?
Q	i'd like to thank the experimenters. i didn't think i'd see this in my lifetime.
Q	it's certainly on a par,
Q	it's certainly as fundamental.
Q	there's absolutely no guarantee,
Q	my nightmare, and it's not just me, but a lot of us [in particle physics], is that the lhc discovers the higgs boson and nothing else,

T	reflections journal: cern strikes boson
C	those magnificent bastards at cern may well have discovered the god particle... and cost stephen hawking a hundred bucks . it seems the renowned physicist had bet against the higgs boson ever being found. it is still not entirely clear that the particle found by the large hadron collider experiments is the higgs. it may be a different boson but they are pretty darned sure that it's a boson. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider, the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. physicists seem very excited. laypeople less so. all those caveats, maybes, and promises of further analysis, make people nervous. personally, i would find certitude more concerning. there is more than enough arrogance coming out of cern already. but the folks at salon are wondering if the price tag for all this theoretical physics is worth it, even if it could provide the key to understanding how the universe is constructed. when it was switched on in 2008, the british government's then chief science advisor, david king, asked whether its $10 billion dollar budget couldn't be put to better use combating climate change or disease. that was before the full of extent of europe's debt crisis was known. had the collider still been in its infancy today, when governments are plundering academic grants and other spending to pay off creditors, its future would doubtless face greater uncertainty. . . . physicists involved in the lhc insist it is worth every cent. it might not offer any tangible benefits at the moment they say, but it is the final part of a century-long journey of scientific discovery that has already gifted mankind many medical and technological breakthroughs. but since the latest announcement out of cern stops short of claiming the existence of higgs boson, is it enough to merit the money lavished upon it? they make the point that a similar research center in the us was shut down last year because of budget constraints. i'd hate to think that this announcement and the hype leading up to it was timed to prevent budget cuts for cern but it's one possibility. i prefer to think that they've really made an incredible discovery and managed to do so without damaging the fabric of the known universe. comments on this entry are closed, on this blog. if you wish to comment, please find this and all newer blog entries crossposted on celestial reflections .

T	have scientists really found the god particle?
C	it is said to be the answer to the big bang theory that explains the creation of the universe. scientists believe they may have discovered it on wednesday. known in scientific circles as higgs boson, or the god particle, its discovery would be an historic achievement. so what is the god particle, and have scientists really discovered it? higgs boson is a subatomic particle that exists for a fraction of a second during the process of the creation of mass. scientists at cern, the european center for nuclear research, located on the border between france and switzerland, have been sending atoms through a 17 mile-long tube at near light speed for decades, in an effort to recreate the so-called big bang theory of the creation of the universe. on wednesday, scientists believed that they found the god particle. "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region of 126 gev," said fabiola gianotti, the head of one of the two main research teams responsible for the findings," according to a time report. the theory is that the god particle, or higgs boson, is the part of a sub-atomic process that actually creates the molecules that form mass, which binds objects together. higgs published his theory in 1964. "one way to think about it is that the (energy) field sticks to the particles, slowing them down and imparting mass," according to the los angles times . there is good reason for the excitement over the potential for the god particle discovery. in simplistic terms, it means that we now know how tiny atoms become large objects with gravity. "we have found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," cern director rolf heuer told time .

T	physicists find particle that could be the higgs boson - nytimes.com
C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times scientists at the fermilab in batavia, ill., on wednesday watched the presentation about the discovery of the higgs boson, which was shown from geneva. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

"as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, sends protons whizzing in a circle at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, head of the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be found, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the theory got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development the way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. physicists hail evidence of 'god particle' scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new

T	voice from the desert ? blog archive ? physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe
C	vatican is graded on financial transparency (but the report remains secret for now) * * * physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe 95 comments aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the proton collisions from the search. readers' comments like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data presented in graphs with bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti noted that the mass of the putative higgs, apparently one of the heaviest subatomic particles, made it easy to study its many behaviors. "thanks, nature," she said. gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause, like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime," he said. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented what came to be known as the higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and fran?ois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough with the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen possible ways, depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not describe how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find, eluding researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare in abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the "goddamn particle.") finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly. so far, the physicists admit, they know little about their new boson. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the boson while others might be underproducing it, clues that maybe there is more at work here than the standard model would predict. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said guido tonelli of cern. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team of physicists, said: "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins." this entry was posted on thursday, july 5, 2012 at 8:28 pm and is filed under vatican is graded on financial transparency (but the report remains secret for now) oregon insurer requires church to take unusual abuse prevention steps from bishop john shelby spong: "think different-accept uncertainty" part xiii: miracles as signs to be interpreted on the roman catholic church and its teachings on sex and women: how does ancient greek medicine impact the church today? from bishop john shelby spong: "think different-accept uncertainty" part xiii: miracles as signs to be interpreted

"what it is? it's the last piece in the 'standard model.' the standard model describes all the matter that we can see in the universe, you, me, the planet, the stars, galaxies, all that matter is described by the standard model. that description only makes sense if a higgs boson exists or something very similar to it." here is the large hadron collider in the cern underground lab which was used to hunt the higgs boson since 1984. professor ellis then explains just what a ground-breaking discovery this is. "so it's very exciting that finally, after so many years of looking and waiting and searching, we may finally discover the missing link that really makes our description of the matter in the universe sensible. maybe it's the higgs boson, maybe it's not higgs boson, but finally, i think, we gonna start seeing the boson." written and presented by ann salter abpanandatv saha institute of nuclear

twitter.com facebook.com could this be the week scientists finally prove the existence of the one true god particle? lead researchers at cern will reportedly hold a press conference this week to confirm the existence of the elusive higgs boson particle. the higgs boson particle is thought to give elementary particles like quarks and electrons mass, and it's confirmed existence may lead to a reevaluation of many theorems in the field of physics. rumor has it scientists are 99.99-percent sure of their discovery, which could be the biggest science news in decades. until the press conference on july 4th, we'll have to wait to see if the god particle has finally been scientifically proven, or if believing in it's existence remains just a scientific act of faith. breaking news: a video from europe's cern physics lab, apparently posted mistakenly on the eve of an announcement on the elusive "god particle," reveals that a new subatomic particle has been observed in the relevant range. the video, already leaked, has been relocated to a password-protected part of the cern web site. mr incandela, the cern spokesman, describes the findings as "one of the biggest discoveries..." before correcting himself to add "... or observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years." finding the higgs boson would vindicate the so-called standard model of physics, a theory that was developed in the early 1970s that says the universe is made from 12 particles that provide the building blocks for all matter. i give an overview of the announcement made on the 4th of july

C	the just discovered higgs boson, nicknamed the god particle, explains an element of physics that has been elusive for decades - why all matter has mass. it could also help explain how the universe really began. (ap) - it's being called the "missing cornerstone of physics." the higgs boson, nicknamed the god particle, explains an element of physics that has been elusive for decades - why all matter has mass. it could also help explain how the universe began. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe's most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible.

T	hunt for the higgs: a bet, a glitch, and a gateway - science news - redorbit
C	hunt for the higgs: a bet, a glitch, and a gateway lawrence leblond for redorbit.com - your universe online about ten years ago british physicist stephen hawking was at a conference in south korea when he made a small wager with university of michigan physicist gordon kane that the long-theorized higgs boson particle did not exist, a bet that kane honored four years later, by sending the world renown physicist a check for $100, acknowledging that there was no higgs. and then, just a few years later, in 2008, when the multi-billion-dollar large hadron collider went into shutdown mode for more than a year due to faulty wiring, many wondered if physicists working at the european organization for nuclear research ( cern ) really had a chance at all of confirming the existence of the elusive "god particle." but after wednesday's revelation that a new particle has been discovered by two separate teams - - scientists around the world are tuning in to see if what was found might actually be the much searched-for higgs boson - a particle that has been long-theorized to have existed briefly after the creation of the universe (the big bang). on thursday, a day after the unveiling at an australian conference, the discovery is being hailed as a "gateway" to a new era that could see humanity finally unlock one of the universe's greatest mysteries. "this is one of the most wonderful discoveries in many, many decades in physics and tells us huge, wonderful things about the understanding of our universe," kane, who co-authored "the higgs hunter's guide," told kim kozlowski at detroitnews .com, adding that this finding is "unbelievably important." the higgs is the cornerstone of physics that scientists have been searching for more than 50 years. it is different than any other particle because it could explain why all the matter in the universe has mass. the university of michigan has been involved in the search for the higgs boson for decades, as has other michigan scientists working with . "this is historic, and it's a real tour de force for the experiments," said robert harr, a professor in wsu's department of physics and astronomy . "this particle has behaviors that are just different than anything we've discovered so far." while the results are still preliminary and it will likely be several months, if not longer, before cern scientists can uncover the true identity of the new particle. even so, the finding is truly significant. cern scientist albert de roeck likened it to the discovery of electricity, a time when humanity could never have imagined the future significance such a discovery would hold. "what's really important for the higgs is that it explains how the world could be the way that it is in the first millionth of a second in the big bang," he told afp . "can we apply it to something? at this moment my imagination is too small to do that." but scrutinizing the new particle and determining whether it supports anything other than the standard model would be the next move for cern, roeck noted. clarification could be expected by the beginning of 2013; but definitive proof that it fitted the standard model could take another two years when the lhc finally runs at exponential power, allowing for the harvest of more data. roeck said this might be a "little boring at the end if it turns out that this is just the standard model higgs." instead, he is hoping it will be a "gateway or a portal to new physics" and new theories. uc davis physicist who is not on either higgs-hunting team, called the collider's performance and the scientists' discovery "a tribute to the progress of civilization." "we've reached the mountaintop, or something like that, by virtue of huge collaborations and huge technical groups that only an organized society could allow," he told the los angeles times . "you couldn't imagine getting to this fundamental level of understanding of the universe without everyone involved." "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer said in a statement. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies ? and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." and perhaps hawking, who acknowledges he may have now lost a $100 bet, said it best: "this is an important result and should earn peter higgs the nobel prize ? but it is a pity in a way, because the great advances in physics have come from experiments that gave results we didn't expect," he told bbc news in an interview. source:

C	theoretical physicist michio kaku explains the larger implications of the god particle's discovery. higgs boson explained in 5 points what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. an image of what is likely the higgs boson or god particle why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next? "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. related posts: large hadron collider: in search of the 'god particle' internet rumors of higgs boson new particle detector is poised to solve cosmic mysteries physics: the eightfold way big bang machine detectors will be 'even more perfect'

"we have a discovery [that is] consistent with a higgs boson," rolf heuer, director of cern, the european research center, said wednesday. "as a layman, i think we did it," he added. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." like us on facebook : follow @franchiseherald so why is it important and gaining so much attention? well that one little particle could explain how matter attains mass and help explain the workings of our entire universe. physicists say the higgs boson would help explain how we, and the rest of the universe, exist. it would explain why the matter created in the big bang has mass, and can coalesce. without it, as cern explained in a paper released to the public, "the universe would be a very different place ... no ordinary matter as we know it, no chemistry, no biology, and no people." the team is calling the results "very preliminary," but it's enough to have the science community breaking out the champagne. the leaders of the two cern teams -- joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists -- each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s, part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. watch a video of the "god particle" announcement at cern: ? 2012 franchise herald. all rights reserved. view the original article here

T	the higgs "boson"
C	the higgs "boson" - photo posted in the faculty of science | sign in and leave a comment below!" style="max-width:675px; max-height:675px; width:expression(this.width> 675?675:true); height:expression(this.height>675?675:true);" /> (reuters) - scientists at europe's cern research center have found a new subatomic particle, a basic building block of the universe, which appears to be the boson imagined and named half a century ago by theoretical physicist peter higgs. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," cern director general rolf heuer told a gathering of scientists and the world's media near geneva on wednesday. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." two independent studies of data produced by smashing proton particles together at cern's large hadron collider produced a convergent near-certainty on the existence of the new particle. it is unclear that it is exactly the boson higgs foresaw, which by bestowing mass on other matter helps explain the way the universe was ordered after the chaos of big bang. but addressing scientists[..]embled in the cern auditorium, heuer posed them a question: "as a layman, i would say i think we have it. would you agree?" a roar of applause said they did. for some, there was no doubt the higgs boson is found: "it's the higgs," said jim al-khalili of surrey university, a british physicist and popular broadcaster. "the announcement from cern is even more definitive and clear-cut than most of us expected. "nobel prizes all round." higgs, now 83, from edinburgh university was among six theorists who in the early 1960s proposed the existence of a mechanism by which matter in the universe gained mass. higgs himself argued that if there were an invisible field responsible for the process, it must be made up of particles. he and some of the others were at cern to welcome news of what, to the embarrassment of many scientists, some commentators have labelled the "god particle", for its role in turning the big bang into an ordered universe. clearly overwhelmed, his eyes welling up, higgs told the symposium of fellow researchers: "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime." scientists see confirmation of his theory as accelerating investigations into the still unexplained "dark matter" they believe pervades the universe and into the possibility of a fourth or more dimensions, or of parallel universes. it may help in resolving contradictions between their model of how the world works at the subatomic level and einstein's theory of gravity. end of an era "it is very satisfying," higgs told reuters. "for me personally it's just the confirmation of something i did 48 years ago," he said of the achievement of the thousands who labored on the practical experimental work which had, finally, confirmed what he and others had described with mathematics. "i had no expectation that i would still be alive when it happened," he said of the speed with which they found evidence. "for physics, in one way, it is the end of an era in that it completes the standard model," he said of the basic theory physicists currently use to describe what they understand so far of a cosmos built from 12 fundamental particles and four forces. cern's large hadron collider is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. two beams of protons are fired in opposite directions around the 27-km (17-mile) looped pipe built under the swiss-french border before smashing into each other. the collisions, which mimic the moments just after the big bang, throw off debris signals picked up by a vast complex of detectors and the data is examined by banks of computers. the two separate cern teams worked independently through that data, hunting for tiny divergences which might betray the existence of the new boson, a class of particle that includes the photon,[..]ociated with light. the class is named in honor of albert einstein's indian collaborator satyendra nath bose. both teams found strong signals of the new particle at around 125 to 126 gigaelectron volts (gev) - a unit of mass-energy. that makes it some 130-140 times heavier than a proton. scientists struggling to explain the theory have likened higgs particles to a throng of paparazzi photographers; the greater the "celebrity" of a passing particle, the more the higgs bosons get in its way and slow it down, imparting it mass; but a particle such as a photon of light is of no interest to the paparazzi and passes through easily - a photon has no mass. presenting the results, joe incandela at cern showed off two peaks on a graph of debris hitting the detectors, which he said revealed the hitherto unseen presence of the enigmatic particle. "that is what we are sure is the higgs," a cern scientist said. less than one in a million "it's a boson!" headlined britain's science and technology facilities council in a statement on the role its researchers had played in the delivery of the "dramatic 5 sigma signal" for the existence of the long-sought particle. five sigma, a measure of probability reflecting a less than one in a million chance of a fluke in the data, is a widely accepted standard for scientists to agree the particle exists. "the fact that both our teams have independently come to the same results is very powerful," oliver buchmueller, a senior physicist on one of the research teams, told reuters. "we know it is a new boson. but we still have to prove definitively that it is the one that higgs predicted." "if i were a betting man, i would bet that it is the higgs. but we can't say that definitely yet. it is very much a smoking duck that walks and quacks like the higgs. but we now have to open it up and look inside before we can say that it is indeed the higgs." al-khalili said the researchers' caution was extreme: "cutting through all the jargon about sigmas and decay channels, the bottom line is that cern have indeed discovered the higgs boson," he said. "in my view, if it looks like the higgs, smells like the higgs and is exactly what we expected from the higgs, then it's the higgs." universal theory the higgs theory explains how particles clumped together to form stars, planets and life itself. without the higgs boson, the universe would have remained a formless soup of particles shooting around at the speed of light, the theory goes. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. what scientists do not yet know from the latest findings is whether the particle they have discovered is the higgs boson as exactly described by the standard model. it could be a variant of the higgs idea or an entirely new subatomic particle that could force a rethink on the fundamental structure of matter. the last two possibilities are, in scientific terms, even more exciting. packed audiences of particle physicists, journalists, students and even politicians filled conference rooms in geneva, london and a major physics conference in melbourne, australia, to hear the announcement. despite the excitement, physicists cautioned that there was still much to learn: "we have closed one chapter and opened another," said peter knight of britain's institute of physics. paul nurse, president of britain's science academy the royal society, said: "this is a big day for science and for human achievement ... today moves us a step closer to a fuller understanding of the very stuff of which the universe is made." 27 minutes ago - 505 comments - by calis legacy join us on facebook. check out the bx fan page and hit the like button. follow bx on twitter to get instant hot topic alerts.

T	eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of particle | world news | the guardian
C	john heilprin associated press= geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. m6 toll coach terror scare caused by vapour from electronic cigarette old ways by robert macfarlane ?12.00 in the moment by tom jenkins ?20.00

C	new particle resembling long-sought higgs boson uncovered at large hadron collider the cern collider, the most powerful atom smasher in history, appears to have fulfilled its primary quest by john matson | wednesday, july 4, 2012 | 28 source: /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// gather round: dozens of students and physicists gathered at columbia university's low library early wednesday morning to get the latest news on the higgs boson. image: john matson new york-the city that never sleeps was mostly asleep. the bars were closed. but at 4:45 a.m., inside a library on columbia university's manhattan campus, michael tuts was getting ready to pop the champagne. the physicist had good reason to celebrate. the massive team of scientists of which he is a part-3,000 researchers working on the atlas experiment at europe's large hadron collider -had just announced the discovery of a new particle. the particle looks an awful lot like the long-sought, and long-hypothetical, higgs boson , most famous for explaining why elementary particles, such as quarks, have mass. a competing, comparably sized experiment, known as cms, had arrived at a very similar finding at the collider facility. both research teams announced their results during a morning seminar at cern, the european laboratory for particle physics that operates the large hadron collider, or lhc. but the morning start in geneva meant that u.s. physicists and other curious observers were tuning in to the announcement during the predawn hours. tuts and his columbia colleagues decided to host a viewing party at the campus library, with a live video feed from cern as well as coffee, cookies, soft drinks and chips. about 50 people, many of them students, turned up for the event, which began around 2:30 a.m. unlike some past announcements centered on the higgs in the past few years, which have produced as much ambiguity and confusion as anything else, this one did not disappoint. atlas physicists said that their most recent data reveal the presence of an unknown particle with a mass of about 126.5 gev, or 126.5 billion electron-volts. an electron-volt is a physicist's unit of mass or energy; for comparison, the proton has a mass of about 1 gev. the cms collaboration found evidence for a new particle with a mass of 125.3 gev. crucially, both teams' findings appear exceptionally robust. in physics terms, evidence for a new particle requires a "3-sigma" measurement, corresponding to a 1-in-740 chance that a random fluke could explain the observations, and a claim of discovery requires a 5-sigma effect, or a 1-in-3.5 million shot that the observations are due to chance. in december representatives of the two experiments had announced what one called "intriguing, tantalizing hints" of something brewing in the collider data. but those hints fell short of the 3-sigma level. the new atlas finding met not just that level of significance but cleared the gold standard 5-sigma threshold, and cms very nearly did as well, with a 4.9-sigma finding. "this is the payoff," tuts said after the two teams had announced their latest analyses in the higgs hunt. "this is what you do it for." peter higgs himself, who was in geneva for the seminar along with other eminent physicists who developed the theory, sounded a similar note after the atlas and cms teams had unveiled their conclusions. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," higgs said to the audience at cern. he was among a half-dozen physicists who in the 1960s proposed what is now known as the higgs mechanism, hypothesizing the existence of a field permeating all of space, along with an associated particle. the field imparts particles with mass by exerting a sort of drag on them, slowing them down much like a human being slows down when she tries to walk through water instead of air. the newfound particle fits the bill for the higgs boson, but the researchers cautioned that more work is needed to compare the properties of the particle to those predicted for the higgs. after all, the lhc's detectors cannot identify the higgs directly. the lhc accelerates protons to unprecedented energies of four trillion electron-volts (4 tev) before colliding a clockwise-traveling proton beam with a counterclockwise beam. from the smash-up new particles emerge, some of them existing for just an instant before decaying to other particles. in the case of the higgs, physicists can only infer its existence and its properties from the more mundane particles it decays to produce-say, gamma-ray photons or pairs of electrons. the new particle has the right mass to be the higgs and broadly decays as predicted, although a few ambiguities remain. fortunately, more data are right around the corner. "we have only recorded one third of the data expected in 2012," atlas spokesperson fabiola gianotti of cern said during her presentation. "this is just the beginning. there is more to come." both gianotti and cms spokesperson joe incandela of the university of california, santa barbara, were greeted by large outbursts of applause when they displayed the slides outlining the results of their higgs search. "there aren't many discoveries like this," columbia physicist brian cole told the group assembled on campus for the early-morning viewing party. "this trumps, i would say, everything in my physics career.?so i hope you all remember this for the rest of your lives." just before sunrise, four columbia undergraduates made their way out of the library and back across campus. only two of them were studying physics, they said-one was focusing on chemistry and another on math. but they all agreed that it had been worth staying up late to see history in the making.

C	something big is up, in subatomic terms, when staid physicists break out the champagne and get downright giddy. but the apparent discovery of the higgs boson is one of those rare moments that caused physicists around the world to take their excitement from the lab into the streets. the elementary particle, the first discovered since the top quark in 1995, is the holy grail of particle physics. it's the missing link and fundamental key of the standard model, the theory explaining the mechanics of the universe. that is, until two separate teams at cern, the multinational research agency with headquarters in geneva, announced the detection of the higgs boson via the $10 billion large hadron collider. scientists believe the particle is responsible for imparting mass to everything, from subatomic particles to people and, in effect, for holding the universe together. without a higgs field as the scaffolding of the universe, the cosmos would consist of disconnected particles bolting about at the speed of light. it is suspected of being the key to "dark matter," the mysterious and hitherto indescribable stuff that makes up most of space. physicists now know the particle is real, as first predicted in 1964 by theorist peter higgs of the university of edinburgh, along with physicists fran?ois englert, robert brout, gerald guralnik, c. r. hagen and tom kibble. the discovery is a triumph for basic scientific research and a key to a deeper understanding of the universe. yet no one knows where it will lead. as nima arkani-hame of the institute for advanced study in princeton, n.j., told the new york times: "it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins." find funds that outperformed peers. discover our disciplined approach. we welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: to comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified disqus account or social network id. sign up here. comments in violation of the rules will be denied, and repeat violators will be banned. please help police the community by flagging offensive comments for our moderators to review. poll how much produce do you generally get in your diet? i usually eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day i eat usually eat about three or four servings of fruits and vegetables each day i eat usually eat about one or two servings of fruits and vegetables each day i don't usually eat produce on a regular basis i usually eat fruit and not vegetables my produce consumption varies a lot on a day to day basis nie major sponsor thanks to chesapeake energy for helping to develop our future readers, writers and thinkers by providing newspapers for area classrooms through the review's newspaper in education program. to our associate sponsors for supporting the nie program.

T	shai's views: god particle or goddamn particle?
C	where does this leaves us? i think after discovery or let us say certain statistical validation or statistical certainty that higs boson exist.. we are going for another round.. scientific community is cheering as this was one of the most important milestone what human brain could think off.. and after all, billions of dollars were invested to find it out. so.. there has to be celebration.. in general i am happy for this great scientific victory.. we do need to continue research in fundamental physics so we can overcome fear of god from human brain. question is what next.. do we understand how mass is created? i don't know if we have final answer to that or no. it seems that this discovery was suppose to achieve that.. i am way too illiterate to understand exact interactions of mass and energy or energy fields.. but if they can find out or more accurately guess for our reason of existence.. that would be great.. there are so many fundamental questions about nature still unanswered.. milestone' discovery physicists eye elusive particle by dennis overbye new york times aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since this past winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider, the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." cern via associated press in this image, two high-energy photons collide in the search for the higgs boson particle. he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the past half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist at uc santa barbara and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data wednesday. at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, n.j., new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the phys-icists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the past two years. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry.

C	tweet thousands of scientists contributed to the discovery of the higgs boson, and among them were some of south africa's brightest minds. about 40 people from seven south african institutions are involved in the south africa-cern programme, which was launched in late 2008. (afp) on wednesday, scientists at the european laboratory for nuclear research (cern), announced that data from two separate experiments independently confirmed that a new particle had been observed. the higgs-like boson, which is consistent with a theory put forward by physicist peter higgs almost 50 years ago, is believed to impart mass to other particles. about 40 people from seven south african institutions are involved in the south africa-cern programme, which was launched in late 2008. according to university of witwatersrand physicist trevor vickey, south african scientists have a permanent presence in geneva. "we rotate our staff and students to contribute to different tasks and maintenance of our detector on site, but through the world-class technology and advanced computer systems, we can analyse our data from almost anywhere in the world." vickey said the south africans at cern were studying a wide range of scientific issues, including the search for the higgs boson, exotic particles and black holes. extraordinary opportunity andrew hamilton, a lecturer at the university of cape town, said the south africa-cern programme was a coup. "it's an extraordinary opportunity for south african science, to train young people in the absolute cutting edge of world science. "being part of cern gives south african students and researchers access to world-class facilities and infrastructure, without having to put the investment into paying the huge infrastructure costs, of billions of euros, which are clearly outside the realms of possibility for south african researchers to pay by ourselves," he said. university of johannesburg prof?essor simon connell credited the department of science and technology (dst) with the vision to back the project. "just like the dst chose the ska [square kilometre array] as a key large infrastructure programme, they also selected involvement in cern," he said. the benefits of south african involvement at cern go beyond the training of local physicists. one of the spin-offs is technology transfer. local scientists are already benefiting from the south african computing grid, a network of computers set up to create a virtual supercomputer, used for data processing and analysis. it is believed that experience with the grid, which was established because of south africa's involvement with cern, will benefit scientists involved with the ska and other data-intensive research units. connell said that, between the ska and the south africa-cern programme, he anticipated a new dawn for particle physics and for astronomy in the country. "there's a strong link between those two," he said. connell could not speculate on the potential technological spin-offs that might result from the discovery of the new particle. thwarted minister pulls rank on director general frequent clashes over how best to run the agriculture department appear to be at the centre of the suspension of director general langa zitha. quotas distinctly fishy, locals say fishermen believe the new 'experimental' permits are an anc ploy to gain their votes. fiona macleod reports. the sacp says it was gwede mantashe's decision to quit, adding he was putting its interests ahead of himself, writes rapule tabane.

C	"this is just the beginning," higgs deserved a nobel prize:stephen hawking london: stephen hawking has said that peter higgs deserved a nobel prize for the groundbreaking discovery of the " god particle", but admitted that the findings have come at a cost for him. the 70-year-old theoretical physicist lost a 100-dollar bet as he believed that the higgs boson wouldn't be found. "i had a bet with gordon kane of michigan university that the higgs particle wouldn't be found. it seems i have just lost 100 dollars," the telegraph quoted hawking as saying. when higgs first proposed that an invisible field strewn across space gave mass to the building blocks of the universe, the theory was ridiculed by some of the most respected minds of the time. his first paper was rejected by a journal, while other scientists accused him and his colleagues of failing to grasp the basic principles of physics. despite the sleights higgs, at the time a 34-year-old physicist at edinburgh university, was convinced that his idea was right although he never envisaged being able to prove it. 48 years on, his radical concept was finally proved correct by an international team of physicists at the cern laboratory using a 6-billion-pound piece of equipment, designed to uncover the secrets of the universe, on wednesday. ----------- a closer look at the higgs boson the magnet core of the world`s largest superconducting solenoid magnet (cms, compact muon solenoid), one of the experiments preparing to take data at european organization for nuclear research (cern)`s large hadron collider (lhc) particle accelerator is seen, near genva. berlin: scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. this image shows a typical candidate event including two high-energy photons whose energy (depicted by red towers) is measured in the cms electromagnetic calorimeter. the yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed or cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature.

C	the big news this week is that the large hadron collider, the massive particle accelerator at the european physics lab cern, has apparently discovered the elusive and long-sought subatomic particle called the higgs boson , which explains why other particles have mass. the hunt for the higgs has consumed decades of effort by physicists all over the world, and its discovery fills in one of the last missing pieces of the wildly successful theoretical framework called the standard model. naturally, scientists worldwide are here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. ...at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. when i look at the massive amounts of human effort and ingenuity invested in finding the higgs - the medieval cathedrals that took lifetimes to build, save that the modern cathedrals of science are devoted to advancing the frontiers of humanity's understanding. this discovery is a moment that people all around the world can and should take pride in. it's what human beings at our best are capable of. but meanwhile, while all this was happening, a hard-line islamist insurgency in the nation of mali was busying itself smashing centuries-old sufi mausoleums at a world heritage site in the city of timbuktu , an appalling act of cultural vandalism that recalls the taliban's destruction of the buddhas of bamiyan: "we are subject to religion and not to international opinion," said an ansar dine spokesman, oumar ould hamaha.

T	autosinsurancess: what are the benefits discovery "god particle"?
C	announcement of the european organization for nuclear research (cern) on the discovery of particles that are consistent with the higgs boson on wednesday (04/07/2012) was greeted by the scientists. the findings also make a scene and the layman wonder. higgs boson is an elementary particle which has long sought. these particles are believed to give mass and plays a role in the formation of the universe. without a higgs boson, the atom would be created, a chemical bond is not formed the universe was not there. although the findings cern announced yesterday is still at an early stage, in a sense not yet reached final conclusions, scientists believe that the higgs boson is found. then, if it has been found, what can be expected from the findings? what is his contribution to mankind? cern scientists, albert de roeck, likens the higgs boson discovery is similar to the discovery of electricity. humans can never imagine what would happen. thus, when asked when this application, then the answer is no. "what is important now is that the higgs boson can explain what might happen in a millionth of a second after the beginning of the universe (theory) big bang," says de roeck as quoted by afp news agency on thursday (05/07/2012). langitselatan site explains, after the big bang, the universe was very hot and filled by a sea of ??protons, neutrons, electrons and other particles. in the first 17 minutes, to form atoms and light elements. this requires the existence of the higgs boson. many scientists say that the discovery of the higgs boson is expected to complete the standard model of particle physics. the standard model of elementary particles describes fermions and bosons. the model also requires the existence of elementary particles that act gives the masses. however, physicists ray volkas another view. higgs boson may also be associated with something else, such as dark matter, invisible material that make up most of the universe, much larger amounts of material that looks human. "i might, for example, hoggs boson as a bridge between ordinary matter, which is composed of atoms, and dark material, which we know is an important component of the universe. that will give a fantastic implications in the understanding of the whole material universe, not just ordinary atoms, "he said. by volkas, would be very boring if the newly discovered particles cern only meet the standard model particle physics. the discovery of the particle is supposed to be the entrance to the new physics, new theories that describe how the universe was created and worked. one is a theory called supersymmetry volkas (susy). in susy, each particle has a partner other particles that are only slightly different characteristics. susy's interesting because as uniting all forces in the universe, including offering the possibility of making up dark matter. volkas said, the study was as if the higgs boson dreamily. however, because of the challenges at cern, for example about the exchange of large amounts of data, research institutions like cern have contributed in the development of world wide web that underlies the internet. at present, cern is still unfinished task. cern should still check what you have just announced yesterday, if the higgs boson or new particles. in between that, cern must face the demands to succeed because it has spend a great cost to his research.

C	somewhat to the regret of his fellow scientists, a physicist dubbed a subatomic particle that once existed only in theory as the "god particle," because without it the physical universe - stars, planets, us - wouldn't exist. the higgs boson - named for university of edinburgh professor peter higgs, one of the six physicists who postulated the particle's existence in 1964 - endows other basic particles, protons, neutrons, electrons, etc., with mass. scientists compare the process of an object acquiring size and weight to passing through molasses - the "higgs field." actually proving its existence proved considerably more difficult. the method chosen involved a 17-mile circular tunnel called the large hadron collider, operated by cern, the european center for nuclear research in geneva. the physicists would send particles rocketing around the collider at high speeds until the particles collided, and then the scientists would study the debris for traces of the higgs boson. to show how painstaking this was, joe incandela, the american physicist who led one of the two teams, said out of some 500 trillion collisions only several dozen produced "events" that could be studied. advanced physics doesn't come cheaply or easily. this discovery took two years, cost more than $10 billion and the work of 6,000 physicists. the scientists detected a faint glimmer of what might be the higgs boson last winter and began homing in on the fleeting, microscopic sightings of what may or may not have been the sought-after particle. cern's director, rolf heuer, was at first reluctant to go beyond saying they had found "a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." but wednesday in geneva, he told physicists gathered there and at webcam viewing stations around the world, "i think we have it." this was greeted with standing ovations, but perhaps no one welcomed his announcement more than dr. higgs, now 83, who was there in geneva for the celebration. updated: teen carjackers pull 82-year-old woman from car, lead police on i-5 chase updated: case dismissed against man who spread gospel in redding using cardboard signs updated: two shot to death in fort jones; victims, suspect identified to protect your privacy, we're no longer allowing e-mail addresses to be used as usernames.

"we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say. but he told the audience that the discovery of something that appears to be so close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. greenville disappointed with amount of bang for $12k fireworks buck eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle' to cheers and standing ovations from scientists, the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it 'consistent' with the long-sought higgs greenville disappointed with amount of bang for $12k fireworks buck paid archives for news older than a week. get the greenville news on your ipad with our free app we hope you have enjoyed your complimentary access. become a subscriber today to enjoy these benefits: ipad-optimized edition mobile site & iphone app are you currently a subscriber? set up your digital access now. you now have full access. thank you for subscribing. access the tablet-optimized site, mobile site and iphone app share your access with any friend or family member subscriber exclusive top 5 daily email newsletter create an account or if you have a digital profile you must have browser cookies enabled to view our site. it's possible that your browser cookies are turned off. to continue using your current web browser, adobe flash must be installed or upgraded:

"we have now found the missing cornerstone of particle physics," rolf heuer, director of the european center for nuclear research (cern), told scientists. he said the newly discovered subatomic particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs boson, which until now has been a theoretical particle, is seen as the key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give an object weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's discovery of it: gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. but now scientists have seen something very much like the higgs boson and can put that knowledge to further use. cern's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider on the swiss-french border, has been creating high-energy collisions of protons to investigate dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. two independent teams at cern said wednesday they have both "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer called it "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is. " asked whether the find is a discovery, heuer answered, "as a layman, i think we have it. but as a scientist, i have to say, "'what do we have?' " "it is consistent with a higgs boson as is needed for the standard model," heuer said. "we can only call it a higgs boson - not the higgs boson." the leaders of the two cern teams - joe incandela, head of cms with 2,100 scientists, and fabiola gianotti, head of atlas with 3,000 scientists - each presented in complicated scientific terms what was essentially extremely strong evidence of a new particle. incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether it is the "standard model" higgs that scottish physicist peter higgs and others predicted in the 1960s - part of a standard model theory of physics involving an energy field where particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. asked his opinion, higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said he also could not yet say. but he told the audience that the discovery of something that appears to be so close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling it a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider built in a 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel. the stunning work elicited standing ovations and frequent applause at a packed auditorium in cern as gianotti and incandela each took their turn. incandela called it "a higgs-like particle" and said "we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found." "thanks, nature!" gianotti said to laughs, giving thanks for the discovery. later, she told reporters that "the standard model is not complete" but that "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything - we are far from that." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman but is used by laymen, not physicists, as an easier way of explaining how the subatomic universe works and got started. incandela said the last undiscovered piece of the standard model could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed. greenville disappointed with amount of bang for $12k fireworks buck eureka! physicists celebrate evidence of 'god particle' to cheers and standing ovations from scientists, the world's biggest atom smasher claimed the discovery of a new subatomic particle wednesday, calling it 'consistent' with the long-sought higgs greenville disappointed with amount of bang for $12k fireworks buck paid archives for news older than a week. get the greenville news on your ipad with our free app we hope you have enjoyed your complimentary access. become a subscriber today to enjoy these benefits: ipad-optimized edition mobile site & iphone app are you currently a subscriber? set up your digital access now. you now have full access. thank you for subscribing. access the tablet-optimized site, mobile site and iphone app share your access with any friend or family member subscriber exclusive top 5 daily email newsletter create an account or if you have a digital profile you must have browser cookies enabled to view our site. it's possible that your browser cookies are turned off. to continue using your current web browser, adobe flash must be installed or upgraded:

T	the indian link in the higgs boson discovery - rediff.com india news
C	"i hate to call it the god particle," says bihar-born professor vivek sharma, one of the first people to know about the existence of the higgs boson, which scientists say is key to understanding the universe in an interview to george joseph "y ou and i exist because of this particle, though i hate to call it the god particle," said professor vivek sharma, one of the first people to know about the existence of the higgs boson, which scientists say is key to understanding the universe. sharma, professor of physics at the university of california, san diego, heads the switzerland-and-france-based european organisation for nuclear research's compact muon solenoid experiment -- one of the two large particle physics detectors built on the large hadron collider -- team that found the higgs boson. two major experiments, one headed by sharma, confirmed the existence of the sub-atomic particle. the discovery is being hailed as one of the most path breaking in modern times. the new particle is 125 times the mass of a proton. without this new particle, matter would not exist. when he was a child, sharma's mother, a sanskrit scholar, had told him that the 'song of creation' in the rig veda says the world was void and formless in the beginning and it was utter chaos. the words moved the young boy. "the song was a record of what the sages saw and thought thousands of years ago," sharma had told from geneva in an interview a while ago. "they were thinking of the origin of the world and from where the mass came to the world. it moved me and has driven me to pursue answers for the ancient question. by the technology of today i am now answering the curiosity posed by my ancestors thousands of years ago." two teams, the cms and atlas, with about 3,000 scientists, were looking for the higgs boson, the subatomic particle considered to be the cause for creating mass. both teams had almost reached at the same conclusion a few months ago. an official announcement was delayed for further studies. the teams have built the most complicated machines ever, like the large hadron collider, the particle accelerator where proton-photon collisions are used to search for the higgs boson. the multination project cost about $10 billion (rs 55,000 crore). "discovery of the higgs boson is a very important and a necessary clue to our understanding of the subatomic world and indeed why the universe exists," sharma told last week. the particle is named after university of edinburgh physicist dr peter higgs, who was one of six physicists in the 1960s who suggested that a kind of cosmic molass pervading space is what gives particles their heft. higgs pointed out that these cosmic molasses would have their own quantum particle, so the branding rights went to him. the particle is also partly named after legendary indian scientist satyendra nath bose, who worked with albert einstein in the 1920s and made discoveries that led to the most coveted prize in particle physics. a large number of indian scientists, representing the saha institute of nuclear physics in kolkata [ images ], the harishchandra research institute in allahabad and the institute of physics in bhubaneswar were also involved in the world's most ambitious experiment over the years. images ] is like a historic father of the project," paolo giubellino, spokesperson of the geneva-based cern, told the press trust of india. how will the discovery impact life and science? "discoveries are made out of the curiosity," sharma told rediff.com . "we do not know how the discoveries will affect our life or knowledge. but the advanced technologies we have developed will percolate soon into public use. an example is the world wide web, which was created at cern for physicists to exchange data seamlessly... we gave this away to the world without cost, and it has led to a complete transformation of how we now communicate? apart from the trillions of dollars of transactions currently happening on the web." as soon as the higgs boson discovery was announced, sharma's eight-year-old daughter, a std ii student in san diego, e-mailed him a congratulatory message. sharma's wife works for motorola. rolf-dieter heuer, director general, cern, and others said that it was too soon to know for sure if the particle they found is an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, the times noted. some physicists are still calling it a 'higgs-like' particle. sharma said that the particle "looks very much like a higgs boson." cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela, a physicist at the university of california, santa barbara, said, "the results are preliminary but the five-sigma signal we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern to hear the announcement july 4. higgs entered the meeting to sustained ovation. the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe. are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient? or is it something more exotic? all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about four per cent of the total. a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96 per cent of the universe that remains obscure, according to cern. sharma said the "plan is to continue searching for new subatomic phenomena for the next decade and more." born in muzaffarpur, bihar, sharma obtained his master's in physics from the indian institute of technology, kanpur. he came to the united states in 1984 for higher studies. he also spent five years at cern in the early 1990s, where he discovered two new subatomic particles. he is a fellow of the american physical society and received the ucsd academic senate award for distinguished teaching. other awards he has won include the cottrell scholar award, research corporation, (1998 ); faculty for the 21st century, project kaleidoscope (1998); and national talent prize, ministry of science & education (india), 1979.

T	the daily star :: news :: science :: a closer look at the higgs boson
C	this undated image made available by cern shows a typical candidate event including two high-energy photons whose energy (depicted by red towers) is measured in the cms electromagnetic calorimeter. (ap photo/cern) berlin: scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. we invite all our readers to share with us their views and comments about this article. israeli tap found in zrarieh points to ongoing intelligence war

T	physicists discover a new particle that may be the higgs boson | science codex
C	pasadena, calif.-physicists at the large hadron collider (lhc) in geneva, switzerland, have discovered a new particle that may be the long-sought higgs boson, the fundamental particle that is thought to endow elementary particles with mass. "this is a momentous time in the history of particle physics and in scientific exploration-the implications are profound," says harvey newman, professor of physics at the california institute of technology (caltech). "this is experimental science at its best." the international team of scientists and engineers-which includes a large contingent from caltech, led by newman and maria spiropulu, professor of physics-says it needs more data to determine for certain if the particle they've discovered is indeed the higgs boson predicted by the standard model, the theory that describes how all particles interact. the results so far, however, show that it has many of the properties expected for such a particle. "one of the most exciting aspects of this observation is that the road remains open for a vast range of 'lookalike' alternatives, where any deviation from the standard model would point the way to the existence of other new particles or forces of nature," newman says. regardless of the exact identity of the new particle, cern's scientists say, the highly anticipated discovery heralds a new era in physics. the physicists revealed their latest results at a seminar at the european center for nuclear research (cern) in geneva, which was shared with the world with a live webcast and the evo (enabling virtual organizations) system developed at caltech. the discovery itself is based on the analysis of an unprecedented amount of data that was collected by the two main detectors at the lhc-the compact muon solenoid (cms) and a toroidal lhc apparatus (atlas). the data was collected with the lhc running at 7 teraelectron volts (tev, a unit of energy) in 2011 and 8 tev in 2012. the caltech team is part of the cms collaboration. using the cms detector, the physicists identified signals that point to a new particle with a mass of 125 gigaelectron volts (gev, a unit of mass; in comparison, the mass of a proton is about 1 gev). the team running the atlas detector, which searches for the higgs using a different method, reported similar results. "this is an incredible, exciting moment," says spiropulu. "even these early results give us important hints as to how mass in the universe came to be. together with hundreds of our colleagues caltech scientists have worked for decades to reach this point: building multiple generations of experiments; designing and building detectors to precisely measure photons, electrons, and muons, which are keys to the discovery; and inventing worldwide systems that empower thousands of physicists throughout the world to collaborate day and night, share and analyze the data, and develop the new techniques leading to this great result." to search for the higgs, physicists have had to comb through the remains of trillions of particle collisions produced by the lhc, which accelerates protons around a ring almost five miles wide to nearly the speed of light. as the protons careen toward each other, a small fraction of them collide, creating other particles such as the higgs. it is estimated that it takes one billion collisions to make just one higgs boson. the higgs is fleeting, however, and quickly decays into lighter particles, which are the traces that allow the higgs to be detected and analyzed. the higgs is predicted to decay in several different ways, or channels, each resulting in different particles. cms focuses mainly on the decay channels that result in two photons or two other particles called z bosons. it was by measuring and analyzing these and other decay particles that the physicists were able to discover the potential higgs. when all the decays are taken into account in combination, the scientists announced, the data for a signal corresponding to a standard model higgs boson have a statistical significance of five sigmas. this means the signal is highly unlikely to be the result of a statistical fluke caused by some rare, background fluctuation. only when data are significant to five sigmas are physicists confident enough to declare a discovery. last december, evidence seen in the data from cms generated plenty of excitement as a result of an excess of events-a slight surplus in particle collision events over what would have been expected if the higgs does not exist-with a statistical significance of just three sigmas. the higgs boson is the last remaining fundamental particle predicted by the standard model yet to be detected, and hopes of detecting it was one of the chief reasons for building the lhc. the lhc accelerator, along with the cms and atlas experiments, are arguably the largest and most complex scientific instruments ever built. despite its many successes, the standard model is incomplete-it does not incorporate gravity or dark matter, for example. one of the goals of physicists, then, is to develop more complete theories that better explain the composition of the universe and what happened during the first moments after the big bang. discovering the higgs boson-or a particle like it-is essential for developing these new theories. the measurements of the new particle, the physicists say, are so far consistent-within statistical uncertainty-with the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. still, they need more data to know for sure whether it is the predicted higgs or something stranger, a higgs lookalike-a prospect that many theorists have long been anticipating. lines and paragraphs break automatically. search for higgs boson at large hadron collider reveals new particle world's fastest camera, created by ucla engineers, used to detect rogue cancer cells loss of protein spdef allows prostate cancer cells to gain foothold at possible sites of metastasis atmospheric scientists release first 'bottom-up' estimates of china's co2 emissions

T	cern physicists announce evidence pointing to existence of higgs boson
C	as expected, scientists at cern's large hadron collider made an announcement of significant confirmation of the existence of the elusive higgs boson, albeit not final confirmation of the existence of what has become popularly, and somewhat incorrectly, known as "the god particle": aspen, colo. - physicists working at cern's large hadron collider said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a potential key to understanding why elementary particles have mass and indeed to the existence of diversity and life in the universe. "i think we have it," said rolf heuer, the director general of cern, in an interview from his office outside of geneva, calling the discovery "a historic milestone." his words signaled what is probably the beginning of the end for one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science. if scientists are lucky, the discovery could lead to a new understanding of how the universe began. dr. heuer and others said that it was too soon to know for sure whether the new particle, which weighs in at 125 billion electron volts, one of the heaviest subatomic particles yet, fits the simplest description given by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half century, or whether it is an imposter, a single particle or even the first of many particles yet to be discovered . the latter possibilities are particularly exciting to physicists since they could point the way to new deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are calling it a "higgs-like" particle. "it's great to discover a new particle but you have find out what its properties are," said john ellis, a theorist at cern, the european organization for nuclear research. joe incandela, of the university of california, santa barbara, and spokesperson for one of two groups reporting data on wednesday called the discovery, "very, very significant. it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years, going way back to the discovery of quarks, for example." here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists that will celebrate its 50th birthday on saturday, the sounds of cheers and popping corks reverberated early wednesday morning against the sawatch range through the roaring fork valley of the rockies, as bleary-eyed physicists watched their colleagues read off the results in a webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london, and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. at cern itself, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into the auditorium, according to guido tonelli, a cern physicist who said the atmosphere was like a rock concert. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a standing ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. and it reaffirms a grand view of a universe ruled by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws, but in which everything interesting in it, such as ourselves, is due to flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, which has ruled physics for 40 years now, the higgs boson is the only visible and particular manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles that would otherwise be massless with mass. particles wading through it would gain heft. without this higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, physicists say all the elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new higgs particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version of the boson - and there are hints of some already - could open a gateway to new phenomena and deeper theories that answer questions left hanging by the standard model: what, for example, is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an email, "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." the cern press release is, of course, cautious in describing what it is the scientists believe they have discovered: geneva, 4 july 2012. at a seminar held at cern 1 today as a curtain raiser to the year's major particle physics conference, ichep2012 in melbourne, the atlas and cms experiments presented their latest preliminary results in the search for the long sought higgs particle. both experiments observe a new particle in the mass region around 125-126 gev. "we observe in our data clear signs of a new particle, at the level of 5 sigma, in the mass region around 126 gev. the outstanding performance of the lhc and atlas and the huge efforts of many people have brought us to this exciting stage," said atlas experiment spokesperson fabiola gianotti, "but a little more time is needed to prepare these results for publication." "the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found," said cms experiment spokesperson joe incandela. "the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director sergio bertolucci. " we stated last year that in 2012 we would either find a new higgs-like particle or exclude the existence of the standard model higgs. with all the necessary caution, it looks to me that we are at a branching point: the observation of this new particle indicates the path for the future towards a more detailed understanding of what we're seeing in the data." five sigma certainty is the gold standard in particle physics and essentially means that the scientists are as certain that they can be that the measurements they recorded are not the result of an anomaly or random chance. as the bbc reports, professor peter higgs himself, who was part of the team of scientists whose work led tot the creation of the theories surrounding the higgs boson and, of course the still-theoretical particle that bears his name, was present for the announcement at cern: prof peter higgs, after whom the particle is named, wiped a tear from his eye as the teams finished their presentations in the cern auditorium. "i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement," he added later. "it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime." it's not often that you get particle physicists emotional, or popping champagne corks early in the morning as one group gathered in aspen, colorado did this morning, so that's a pretty good indication of just how big a deal this discovery is, and tom chivers tries to explain what it all means in layman's terms: first, as was hinted yesterday, the cms detector - one of the two major experiments at the large hadron collider - has definitely found something . prof james incandela, the spokesman for the experiment, said they have seen something "very strong, very solid" at the 125gev (gigaelectronvolt) mass, where they had thought they'd seen something in december. the first slide showed a curve of results, with a single bump up at 125gev. "it's hard to leave that [slide]. sorry, i was lost for a moment", prof incandela said, wonderingly. the atlas experiment has found a result in a similar (125gev to 126gev) range, prof fabiola giannotti has told the audience. second, there's still some confusion over whether it is the standard model higgs, or something different. the results of the various collisions showed some variation: some "channels" showed something very higgs-like, while others showed something different. it's not clear yet whether the difference between the two is statistical noise or whether there is something more. sean carroll, a physicist who is liveblogging the result for discover magazine, asks : "are we seeing a standard higgs with a couple of statistical fluctuations, or are differences in different channels the sign of something new?" third, whether it's the predicted higgs or something subtly (or wildly) different, a new particle has almost certainly been spotted. with all the the cms data combined, the result is a 4.9 standard deviation result. the arbitrary mark for a "discovery" is five standard deviations. cern isn't announcing an official discovery - that is expected in the next few months - but it is around 99.9999 per cent likely that this isn't a statistical fluke. actually, it would probably be much more interesting if it turned out that this new particle link). what's more impressive is that they did it in their spare time, not as their focus. but i'm afraid that is also an indictment of high-expense, high-energy, physics. big science is about ego and not roi. @ ben? actually?we spent the money on tax cuts for the rich. yup, the world would have been a better place if newton, pasteur, planck, einstein, watson and crick and the others who did the big science of their day had just taken up cards as a hobby - to paraphrase monty python, "what has (big science) ever done for us? nothing!" btw, those who point out how wasteful basic physics research is have some pretty impressive examples they can draw on - google the basic reaction to faraday's research on electricity, it was generally considered to be a waste of time and resources. our knowledge of chemistry, biochemistry, solid state electronics, and a number of things people take for granted came out of basic physics research that probed what "matter" was actually composed of. and its been called a waste of resources almost every step of the way ? usually with the caveate "yes, what we've learned so far is useful, but there's nothing more of use to be learned, so stop wasting resources looking into it". the discovery should have been made in the u.s., but we couldn't spare $20 billion for a supercollider. instead we spent trillions on better ways to kill, which of course is money well spent. with ebt cards and abortion? oh you meant the military and its scientists, the ones who have allowed you to cry and talk crap about them in english and with a head? why on earth do we need to make this kind of discovery? why isn't it better and cheaper to let the europeans count angels on pins? or how many dinosaurs it takes to make a barrel of oil? i will get excited when they make a breakthrough on time travel, which they will probably keep secret. this is the reason that thing was built to start with. do you think they will go back and try to kill jesus in the womb or his mom? actually?we spent the money on tax cuts for the rich. i can imagine the discussion in trying to get a cern-like project here today. seriously?republicans don't even believe evolution?try explaining the higgs boson to sarah palin or michelle bachmann. truly?why don't you explain evolution to me. i am feeling kind of down on this independence remembrance day and need a good laugh to cheer me up. that is without a doubt the most amazingly stupid post i have ever seen. can you show that the apollo guidance computer was anything other than an instance of then state of the art? video games did far, far, more to fund and advance computer science. when atari started buying 6502s, they bought more computers than had existed in history before. omg, do you think those are examples of "big science," the kinds of national hubris projects which attract billions? faraday did not receive a budget prominent enough to earn a line-item on his nations budget. what part of "big science" don't you understand? @ seriously?republicans don't even believe evolution?try explaining the higgs boson to sarah palin or michelle bachmann. we already know their opinions, i think: ethical challenges have been raised as well, with many considering the search for the so-called "god particle" to be a sign of human hubris. an analogy can be made to the biblical tower of babel. actually "big science" has always meant the same thing - science aiming at the fundamentals of a discipline. it was true of what newton and the royal society was doing (and the politics there were quite involved), in what faraday was doing, in what watson and crick were doing (and the race with linus pauling even had nationalistic overtones), and what is going on now. i'm an electrical engineer now, with graduate degrees in physics and engineering. if i ask a colleage for an example of big science, i suspect the first example i'd hear would be maxwell's equations (electrical engineers just think of that first) - and then after a pause probably newton's laws, quantum mechanics, and relativity. you seem to be talking about "expensive science" rather than "big science". there is some overlap - probing fundamental forces has always been expensive, and will probably become increasingly more so with time. but the rewards tend to be huge as well. would you really want to have medicine based on an understanding of physics that doesn't include the atom, electrons etc - ie no chemistry (all based on orbitals etc), biochem, molecular biology? there was no reason to search for those particles, other than the drive to understand what matter was made of. it would have made as much sense to stop researching fundamental physics in 1800 as it does today - no one was saying "we're going to come up with electricity, solidstate physics, biochem and all these things in a century or two if we research matter." make up your own semantics then. for me, and most people, big science is the stuff that kings and congresses fund. they are unified by their cost, not by their domain or their focus. a tremendous amount of good science was not big science in those terms. what did watson and crick's investigation into the structure of dna cost? what was it's later import? think about it. and don't hand-wave that pursuit of the boson must be important, because it's expensive, or because it's physics. your opinions regarding anyone who does anything other than engineering are well known. i'm afraid i don't agree. i've endorsed any number of scientific projects that are smaller, less expensive, and answer more pressing questions. .[1] individual or small group efforts, or small science, is still relevant today as theoretical results by individual authors may have a significant impact, but very often the empirical verification requires experiments using constructions, such as the large hadron collider costing between $5 and $10 billion. not even faraday's or newton's work was just done by individuals, or even small groups. read up on the collaboration (and competition) at the time. by the time of pasteur, let alone watson and crick, there were many groups around the world working on the base problems (watson and crick for instance relied on huge advances in x-ray diffraction, which they didn't develope themselves - others did, and that had been paid for mainly by gov'ts around the world). all that's changed in the definition is that in the case of cern the research is done in one location, instead of spread out over many countries. the romantic notion of a small group of scientists sitting in a room cut off from everyone else coming up with new science is nice, but has almost always been fictional. the only thing that changes with cern is that its a single location, instead of distributed. btw, anjin talked way up top about space flight. the big science aspect of that, the "manned" part, has arguably slowed funding in the most fruitful areas. unmanned. we are getting very good at crawling, walking, swimming, and flying drones, but we don't send them to space. why not? this is the kind of question that will frustrate the conventional thinker. because nasa in the 60?s rocked so hard, it must rock now, right? to borrow a phrase, "what have you done for me lately?" can anyone name an advance that came directly out of the "manned" part of space, even in the last 20 years? (the conventional thinker might also worry that if "manned" is not the best investment in this decade, that closes the door on the next. no, actually. good drone-craft can open the door for easier manned missions in the future. see also bootstrapping and automated mining and fabrication.) ?try explaining the higgs boson to sarah palin or michelle bachmann. perhaps they would think that was a character from the dukes of hazzard ? truly?why don't you explain evolution to me. for me, and most people, big science is the stuff that kings and congresses fund. they are unified by their cost, not by their domain or their focus. what cost more? shutting down the final construction the waxahachie project or completing it? @ john personna as i said, you should do some reading on the agc. this is a good place to start: @g.a.: that is without a doubt the most amazingly stupid post i have ever seen. oddly enough, despite graduate degrees in engineering and physics, and working as a researcher and engineer for decades, i'd never heard of the term "big science" used that exclusively before - it does show up sometimes that way in trade literature ( ieee proceedings, nature, science etc), but it also shows up as often in the same literature in terms of teaching efforts at elementary or high schools (seriously, just put "big science" into google, you'll see both hits matching the the wiki definintion, and as many hits on educational programs that have nothing to do with large projects). i guess out of habit i was thinking more of the general "big science" term than the narrow wiki definition "big science" element, and i'd guess you've missed the educational element. my apologies for that on my part, in the context i should have guessed you meant the narrow definition, and gone with that. having said that, my argument stands - its been centuries since small groups of scientists made independent progress without relying on the work of others. einstein built his work not just on his thought experiments, but on everything from micheleson-morely to tullio levi-civita and gregorio ricci-curbastro (and possibly poincare, though that's in debate), not to mention the work maxwell did etc, or planck and so on. any discovery in the last century made by an individual or small group is dependent upon the work of hundreds or thousands of others, most of which is paid for by governments via universities or research bodies, and the only difference in something like cern is that its in one institution rather than spread out throughout the world. ok fine ;-), they are there but not with the emphasis i'd like. they, and satellites of various sorts, are the best of what we do. as i understand it, early space flight computers were actually conservative designs, concerned with resistance to radiation more than anything else. from your link: the apollo guidance computer (agc) was built by raytheon and used approximately 4000 discrete integrated circuits from fairchild semiconductor. do you understand what that means? build from discrete components? you can say "your point stands" but if you aren't directly addressing the roi of big science projects (by the modern definition), you aren't really answering mine. i think the public, even the educated public, has fallen into a pattern. they think that an arbitrary mega-project has a payoff because unrelated mega-projects did in the past. that might be overall, my frustration yesterday was that so many people pushed back at me, that i was wrong, without understanding what i was saying. @ john personna roi do you understand what that is? . can you show that the apollo guidance computer was anything other than an instance of then state of the art? it's a frequently cited truth that the space program resulted in the accelerated development of integrated circuitry. it was the agc more than any other single part of this program that drove ic development, an observation eldon hall makes in his book journey to the moon. in fact, in the early stages, a significant proportion of all ics manufactured in the world were going to the agc . computationally, the agc was behind contemporary technology by the time of apollo 11, but this is a common feature of space programs that have multi-year timetables and systems of extreme complexity. in october of 1969, the computer industry journal, datamation, noted that dec's pdp-11 was much more powerful than the agc, but this is beside the point. simpler systems are inherently easier to program, maintain, and fail less often. as gordon bell, father of the minicomputer at dec has often noted: "the most reliable components are the ones you leave out." the apollo guidance computer program was a landmark both in terms of hardware design and software management and laid the foundation for spacelab and shuttle computer systems development. the key to what you just told us was: "datamation, noted that dec's pdp-11 was much more powerful than the agc" it is actually amusing that this is followed with: "but this is beside the point" you cannot at once argue that the agc advance computing hardware, and then that it's simplicity is what advanced ? something? no, what you've quoted is handwaving. the agc was a very good design, and i'm sure an advancement in radiation-resistant computing, but that is a side branch rather than main trunk of the computing tree. btw, i think the "what have you done for me lately" question is important. it ties to the "improper generalization" critique. the strength or weakness of a 50 year old computer does not argue the value of current big science projects. if there was one good big science project, and you keep returning to it, that might prove my point. that is, that good projects are rare, not recent, and a distraction from the good small science going on. the strength or weakness of a 50 year old computer does not argue the value of current big science projects. actually i'm trying to address your point about big science projects. my argument is that whether the amount of money and effort is distributed in a thousand labs across universities around the world (paid for by gov'ts), or a few big labs centered in a few countries, the expenditure and effort is the same - and in fact, it may well be cost effective to have a large series of experiments in one facility like cern, instead of a lot of smaller ones spread out throughout the world. of course, there is the problem with systematic errors in having one big facility, and if that's your concern i concede the point. particle physics has pushed far, far, from the real world. interesting small science is meanwhile happening on lab benches. graphene? well, as one of my physics profs once said, "show me an atom". physics has been a long way from the "real world" (assuming you mean everyday experience and not some alternative reality) since relativity and quantum mechanics. in fact, the going quote among physicists with regard to quantum mechanics is still "if you think you understand it, you're either delusional or haven't really looked at it". as you're well aware, what's going on in the semi-conductor material running your computer is nonsense in terms of "real world". there is a higher risk of opportunity cost in big science projects. it's like putting everything on 17, rather than more bets. the more concentrated the spending, the fewer other things done. speaking of other science i love, i love darpa, especially in the glory days. darpa was about small bets strategically placed. the human genome project has an interesting history. it was ultimately a race between publicly funded and privately funded researchers. a horse race, down to the wire. btw, on that. if you think that hawking argued that super-colliders were the best possible use of scientific funding in the 2010?s, and that there were no opportunity costs, maybe you should link to that, rather than your 6th grade "go ask him" there is a higher risk of opportunity cost in big science projects. it's like putting everything on 17, rather than more bets. the more concentrated the spending, the fewer other things done. that's true. and as i said, systematic errors can be much more critical in single lab projects (like cern) - its certainly not a slam dunk that its the way to go. but it seems to be the only way we currently have to test some theories (and the importance of the standard model is huge). it'd be especially nice to come up with some way to test string theory, though that's going to resist brute force (ie high energy impact) methods for a very long time. and maybe some genius will come up with a different (and cheaper) way of testing the predictions of the standard model besides smashing things together - that would be the ideal solution. but so far no one seems to have come up with something. i suppose it comes down to how important is it to test our fundamental theories - if you don't feel its particularly important, then you're right, things like cern are a waste of money. if you think it is, then they're a bargain (ie there's a lot of non-fundamental research going on which taken as a whole costs more, with all the research grants, university positions and building space etc). i tend to belong to the mindset that feels you have to get the fundamentals down right (and i'd argue the history of physics backs this - for instance the change from classical to quantum mechanics eventually unleashed a lot of technology that no amount of classical physics would have even hinted at). against that, some say that practical, day to day research is all that's really needed (ie you don't need to understand orbitals to mix chemicals and come up with new substances, though it makes it easier). @ john personna one of the things i learned in 6th grade is that the fly by wire systems we use now came, in part from the apollo program, and it was perfected by a joint nasa/mit program with a lot of early support from neil armstrong. fly by wire is a important technology, in use in nearly every large aircraft in the world, and it is now moving into the consumer realm in the form of computer assisted driving technology. i suppose it comes down to how important is it to test our fundamental theories - if you don't feel its particularly important, then you're right, things like cern are a waste of money. if you think it is, then they're a bargain (ie there's a lot of non-fundamental research going on which taken as a whole costs more, with all the research grants, university positions and building space etc). it's certainly a bargain when it's other people's money spent. i think we made the right (final) decision not to build the texas supercollider, though we wasted a lot of money first. here's the thing about any allocation though, be it subatomic particles or manned space ? the decision is not a "yes or no." it's a "now or later." i think "now" should go to currently low-hanging fruit, and that will change over time. i don't think bosons are low-hanging, or fruit (in the sense of roi). did you just dodge away with another 60?s might-have-been? did you just dodge away with another 60?s might-have-been? that's just stupid. your car's controls have thousands of antecedents. they do not prove that supercolliders are the best science investment, that big science, is the best investment in the 2010s.

T	our place in the world: 843. physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe
C	by dennis, overbye, the new york times , july 4, 2012 scientists in geneva on wednesday applauded the discovery of a subatomic particle that looks like the higgs boson. aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson , a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data presented in graphs with bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti noted that the mass of the putative higgs, apparently one of the heaviest subatomic particles, made it easy to study its many behaviors. "thanks, nature," she said. gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause, like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime," he said. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented what came to be known as the higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and fran?ois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough with the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen possible ways, depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not describe how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find, eluding researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare in abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the "goddamn particle.") finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly. so far, the physicists admit, they know little about their new boson. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the boson while others might be underproducing it, clues that maybe there is more at work here than the standard model would predict. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said guido tonelli of cern. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team of physicists, said: "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins."

T	voa special english - in the news - scientists may have found 'god particle'
C	???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? fabiola gianotti, atlas team spokeswoman, and joe incandela, from the cms team, look at a screen wednesday during a scientific seminar to deliver the latest update in the search for the higgs boson this is in the news in voa special english. this week, scientists in switzerland reported a big discovery about a very small particle. they think they have finally found a higgs boson, or what some people call the "god particle." it could answer some basic questions about the universe and the creation of planets and life. rolf heuer is the director-general of cern, the european center for nuclear research, which reported the find. rolf heuer: "i think we have a success today. we have a discovery. we have discovered a new particle, a boson -- most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out which kind of higgs boson this is. does it have the properties which we expect from the standard model? if not, what are its properties and where do they point to?" in particle physics, the standard model is sometimes called "a theory of almost everything" that affects how subatomic particles interact and affect each other. subatomic means smaller than an atom. scientists believe the higgs boson could explain how matter gets its mass. mass is the amount of material in an object that gives it weight in the presence of gravity. the subatomic particle that scientists have found fits the description of the higgs boson predicted by physicist peter higgs. scientists have been searching for it for forty-five years. peter higgs attended the event at cern on wednesday but did not want to say much about the findings. peter higgs: "i think it is not appropriate for me to answer any detailed questions at this stage. this is an occasion celebrating an experimental achievement, and i should congratulate the people involved." theorists believe the higgs boson existed only during the first millionth of a millionth of a second after the big bang. that was the huge explosion when the universe was created more than thirteen billions years ago. physicists at cern are trying to recreate the high energies that existed at the time of the big bang. cern has the world's biggest atom-smasher, the large hadron collider. this ten-billion-dollar collider produces high-energy crashes to investigate mysteries like dark matter and the creation of the universe. the results presented wednesday are based on findings collected last year and this year from two experiments, called atlas and cms. the scientists involved say more research must be done to be sure of their results. however, a spokesman for one of the experiment teams, joe incandela, says the boson is unlike any particle found so far. joe incandela: "we are reaching into the fabric of the universe at a level we have never done before. this is telling us something. it is key to the structure of the universe. we are on the frontier now. we are at the edge of a new exploration and this could open up -- maybe we see nothing extraordinary, and we understand that maybe this is the only part of the story that is left. or maybe we open up a whole new realm of discovery." cern had been planning to shut down its atom-smasher for two years for maintenance work. but because of these results, it will keep the large hadron collider in service for another two to three months. about two hundred people gathered at the fermi national accelerator laboratory in the united states at two o'clock in the morning to watch the announcement from geneva. fermilab's robert roser points out the scientists at cern were careful to say they found a "higgs-like" object. robert roser: "it's a subtle difference and so what they will do over the course of the many years, they will start to investigate all of its properties to see if it acts, if it smells, tastes, and behaves the way they expect it to." and that's in the news in voa special english. i'm steve ember.
Q	god particle.
Q	i think we have a success today. we have a discovery. we have discovered a new particle, a boson -- most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out which kind of higgs boson this is. does it have the properties which we expect from the standard model? if not, what are its properties and where do they point to?
Q	a theory of almost everything
Q	i think it is not appropriate for me to answer any detailed questions at this stage. this is an occasion celebrating an experimental achievement, and i should congratulate the people involved.
Q	we are reaching into the fabric of the universe at a level we have never done before. this is telling us something. it is key to the structure of the universe. we are on the frontier now. we are at the edge of a new exploration and this could open up -- maybe we see nothing extraordinary, and we understand that maybe this is the only part of the story that is left. or maybe we open up a whole new realm of discovery.

C	john heilprin associated press= geneva (ap) - scientists at the world's biggest atom smasher hailed the discovery of "the missing cornerstone of physics" wednesday, cheering the apparent end of a decades-long quest for a new subatomic particle called the higgs boson, or "god particle," which could help explain why all matter has mass and crack open a new realm of subatomic science. first proposed as a theory in the 1960s, the maddeningly elusive higgs had been hunted by at least two generations of physicists who believed it would help shape our understanding of how the universe began and how its most elemental pieces fit together. as the highly technical findings were announced by two independent teams involving more than 5,000 researchers, the usually sedate corridors of the european center for nuclear research, or cern, erupted in frequent applause and standing ovations. physicists who spent their careers in pursuit of the particle shed tears. the new particle appears to share many of the same qualities as the one predicted by scottish physicist peter higgs and others and is perhaps the biggest accomplishment at cern since its founding in 1954 outside geneva along the swiss-french border. rolf heuer, director of cern, said the newly discovered particle is a boson, but he stopped just shy of claiming outright that it is the higgs boson itself - an extremely fine distinction. "as a layman, i think we did it," he told the elated crowd. "we have a discovery. we have observed a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." the higgs, which until now had been purely theoretical, is regarded as key to understanding why matter has mass, which combines with gravity to give all objects weight. the idea is much like gravity and isaac newton's early theories. gravity was there all the time before newton explained it. the higgs boson was believed to be there, too. and now that scientists have actually seen something much like it, they can put that knowledge to further use. the center's atom smasher, the $10 billion large hadron collider, sends protons whizzing around a circular 27-kilometer (17-mile) underground tunnel at nearly the speed of light to create high-energy collisions. the aftermath of those impacts can offer clues about dark matter, antimatter and the creation of the universe, which many theorize occurred in a massive explosion known as the big bang. most of the particles that result from the collisions exist for only the smallest fractions of a second. but finding a higgs-like boson was one of the biggest challenges in physics: out of some 500 trillion collisions, just several dozen produced "events" with significant data, said joe incandela of the university of california at santa barbara, leader of the team known as cms, with 2,100 scientists. each of the teams confirmed wednesday that they had "observed" a new subatomic particle - a boson. heuer said the discovery was "most probably a higgs boson, but we have to find out what kind of higgs boson it is." he referred to the discovery as a missing cornerstone of science. as the leaders of the two teams presented their evidence, applause punctuated their talks. "thanks, nature!" joked fabiola gianotti, the italian physicist who heads the team called atlas, with 3,000 scientists, drawing laughter from the crowd. later, she told reporters that the standard model of physics is still incomplete because "the dream is to find an ultimate theory that explains everything. we are far from that." incandela said it was too soon to say definitively whether the particle was exactly the same as envisioned by higgs and others, who proposed the existence of an energy field where all particles interact with a key particle, the higgs boson. higgs, who was invited to be in the audience, said wednesday's discovery appears to be close to what he predicted. "it is an incredible thing that it has happened in my lifetime," he said, calling the discovery a huge achievement for the proton-smashing collider. outside cern, the announcement seemed to ricochet around the world with some of the speed and energy of the particle itself. in an interview with the bbc, the world's most famous physicist, stephen hawking, said higgs deserved the nobel prize. hawking said he had placed a wager with another scientist that the higgs boson would never be found. "it seems i have just lost $100," he said. marc sher, a professor of physics at william & mary college, said most observers concluded in december that the higgs boson would soon be discovered, but he was "still somewhat stunned by the results." the phrase "god particle" was coined by nobel prize-winning physicist leon lederman, but it's used mostly by laymen as an easier way of explaining the theory. wednesday's celebration was mainly for researchers who explore the deepest, most esoteric levels of particle science. but the particle-hunting effort has paid off in other ways for non-scientists, including contributing to the development of the world wide web. cern scientists used the early web to exchange information, and the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher also boosted development of cloud computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy, medical imaging and proton therapy used in the fight against cancer have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. the last undiscovered piece of the standard model of physics could be a variant of the higgs that was predicted or something else that entirely changes the way scientists think about how matter is formed, incandela said. "this boson is a very profound thing we have found," he said. "we're reaching into the fabric of the universe in a way we never have done before. we've kind of completed one particle's story. ... now we're way out on the edge of exploration." the discovery is so fundamental to the laws of nature, incandela said, that it could spawn a new era of technology and development in the same way that newton's laws of gravity led to basic equations of mechanics that made the industrial revolution possible. old ways by robert macfarlane ?12.00 in the moment by tom jenkins ?20.00

T	scientists discover subatomic particle at the center of everything
C	scientists discover subatomic particle at the center of everything it was the biggest of big science, a $10 billion effort involving 6,000 researchers, a 17-mile circular tunnel deep beneath the border of france and switzerland, thousands of torpedo-size magnets capable of bending beams of subatomic matter, and trillions of subatomic collisions - all in the quest for a momentary hint, the slightest residual footprint, of an elusive particle called the higgs boson. and it worked. wednesday's announcement by scientists in europe that they'd found the higgs boson, or something remarkably higgs-like, was a stunning triumph of both theory and experiment. peter higgs, a theorist who envisioned the particle as a young man in 1964, teared up as he attended the discovery announcement in geneva. "it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime," higgs, 83, said when he took the microphone before a packed auditorium at cern, the european organization for nuclear research, which operates the higgs-hunting large hadron collider. the higgs - famously dubbed "the god particle," to the chagrin of scientists - is so fundamental to the universe that, in its absence, nothing could exist. the particle is thought to create a sort of force field that permeates the cosmos and imbues other particles with the property known as mass - the resistance to being shoved around. actively hunted since the 1970s, the higgs is the final major piece of the standard model, which for physics is the equivalent of chemistry's periodic table. "to the layman i now say, i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, director general of cern. "do you agree?" he asked the crowd. applause broke out. "we have a discovery," heuer said. "we have discovered a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. it's a historic milestone today." the scientists at cern then stood and cheered for a full minute. the geneva announcement was a global event, observed in every time zone. scientists gathered at 3 a.m. eastern in universities and laboratories across the united states to watch the webcast. as late as tuesday afternoon, the leaders of the search weren't sure whether they could announce an actual "discovery" of a new particle or whether they would have to fudge their language, deferring to strict notions of scientific certainty. but after a final run of the data, officials concluded that two detectors, named atlas and cms, and operated by separate scientific teams, had met the standard for proving that the particle was real and not an experimental quirk. what remains unknown is whether the new particle is the theorized higgs of the standard model, or is merely "higgs-like." important properties of the particle remain unclear, such as whether it spins, and whether it interacts with other particles in the expected manner of the theorized higgs. regardless of whether it's the higgs or a higgs imposter, it's a very real particle, and newly known to science, and apparently fundamental to the texture of the universe. "having written my first paper on how and where to look for the higgs boson back in 1975, this is certainly a big day!" said cern theorist john ellis, who celebrated with champagne at a private gathering at his home with peter higgs the night before the announcement. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered." "it looks like a higgs; it quacks like a higgs; but we need dna tests (more data) to make sure it is the higgs," michael turner, a university of chicago physicist who watched the announcement at a gathering of physicists in aspen, colo., said by e-mail. "for now, it is time to celebrate a little and spike the ball in the end zone." the standard model lists and arranges the particles and forces of nature. many of the particles were predicted long before they were found. the higgs was the final holdout. it was also the most important, because it is thought to give rise to the "higgs field," a sort of force field that permeates everything. "we know the higgs is at the center of everything," said joe lykken, a theoretical physicist who worked on one of the two cern experiments that found evidence of the new particle. "this is why [nobel prize-winning physicist] leon lederman called it the god particle. it talks to all the other particles in some fundamental way." when the other particles that make up the stuff of the universe - protons, neutrons, electrons and so on - interact with the higgs field, they acquire the trait known as mass. more-massive objects get tangled up in the field more than less-massive objects. one way to think of the higgs field: it's the water the entire universe swims in. a photon, which is a light particle, has no mass because it zips through the higgs ocean without interacting with it. light speed is the cosmic speed limit for this reason - because nothing can have less-than-zero interaction with the higgs field. (mass can then be described as the quality that keeps everything from moving at the speed of light.) a neutrino has an extremely small mass - it moves at nearly the speed of light (and not faster, as some european scientists suggested last year erroneously before finding that a loose cable was the culprit for their weird results). ordinary matter that makes up the bulk of stars, planets and human beings is relatively massive. the most massive particles move like someone trying to walk through neck-high water. the cern physicists did not see the new particle directly, because it disintegrates too quickly. rather, they divined its existence from sifting through the debris of trillions of high-energy subatomic collisions, and then searching for clues that the higgs had been there. it's like divining the presence of an elusive snow leopard by studying thousands of crisscrossed paw prints. but by studying these traces, the cern physicists saw a "bump" in their data consistent with a higgs boson. the two independent teams from the atlas and cms experiments served as cross-checks for each other. the teams, each with more than 3,000 scientists, were not to share their results before the seminar wednesday at cern. the large hadron collider creates beams of particles that move in opposite directions and then collide inside cathedral-size detectors that are parked in vast caverns along the tunnel. the detectors capture traces of the collisions. inside this subatomic wreckage, both detectors saw evidence of a subatomic particle with a mass of about 125 giga-electron volts - or about 125 times the mass of a proton. cern announced in december that it was homing in on the higgs but cautioned that it needed a new batch of high-energy collisions to gain confidence that scientists were seeing something real and not a random bump in the data. months of collisions pushed the data into the discovery zone. "one of the most exciting weeks of my life," lykken said. columbia university physicist brian greene, speaking before the announcement, said, "everything i've ever done, directly or indirectly, has something to do with a higgs-like field." the discovery of the higgs is the latest reminder, he said, that the universe can be understood through mathematics. "it makes you feel good as a theorist," greene said. "math really does provide a window on reality!" at fermilab, longtime home of the u.s. high-energy physics community, about 300 people stuffed into two rooms to watch a video feed from geneva, said don lincoln, a fermilab physicist who contributed to the cern experiments. "it's incredible," lincoln said. "people were riveted." at columbia university in new york, 75 people shared champagne brought by experimental physicist michael tuts. "it was great fun to see the culmination of years and years of work," tuts said. the discovery hardly ends the quest to understand the essence of space, time, energy and matter. among the remaining mysteries are dark matter, the unknown substance observed only through its gravitational effects, and dark energy, a cosmic force that seems to be causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. turner, the university of chicago physicist, said after the announcement, "okay, the particle physicists got their number 1 wish - the higgs. now we cosmologists want ours - the dark-matter particle." ocean explorer ballard finds pilot bodies, turkish military says medical mystery: male sexual dysfunction drug cures her exhaustion

T	the daily star :: news :: science :: higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind
C	higgs-like particle found in 'milestone' for mankind geneva: after a quest spanning nearly half a century, physicists on wednesday said they had found a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the higgs boson which is believed to confer mass. rousing cheers and a standing ovation broke out at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) after scientists presented data in their long search for the mysterious particle. the new find is "consistent with (the) long-sought higgs boson," cern declared in a statement. it added further data was needed to identify the find. "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature," said cern director general rolf heuer. "the discovery of a particle consistent with the higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe." peter higgs, a shy, soft-spoken british physicist who published the conceptual groundwork for the particle, back in 1964, expressed joy. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge," he said in a statement issued by the university of edinburgh, where he was a professor. finding the higgs would validate the standard model, a theory which identifies the building blocks for matter and the particles that convey fundamental forces. it is a hugely successful theory but has several gaps, the biggest of which is why some particles have mass but others do not. mooted by higgs and several others, the boson is believed to exist in a treacly, invisible, ubiquitous field created by the big bang some 13.7 billion years ago. when some particles encounter the higgs, they slow down and acquire mass, according to the theory. others, such as particles of light, encounter no obstacle. cern uses a giant underground laboratory where protons are smashed together at nearly the speed of light, yielding sub-atomic debris that is then scrutinized for signs of the fleeting higgs. the task is arduous because there are trillions of signals, occurring among particles at different ranges of mass. over the years, tens of thousands of physicists and billions of dollars have been thrown into the search for the higgs, gradually narrowing down the mass range where it might exist. two cern laboratories, working independently of each other to avoid bias, found the new particle in the mass region of around 125-126 gigaelectronvolts (gev), according to data they presented on wednesday. both said that the results were "five sigma," meaning there was just a 0.00006 percent chance that what the two laboratories found is a mathematical quirk. "the results are preliminary but the five sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic," said joe incandela, spokesman for one of the two experiments. "this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." scientists began to pore over what the historic find could mean. "(the higgs) has been anticipated for more than four decades and were it not there theorists all over the world would have been back to their drawing boards in desperation," said anthony thomas at the university of adelaide in australia. cern physicist yves sirois agreed. "this could the higgs boson that has been found, which may shed light on how matter came into being at the very start of the universe, a thousandth of a billionth of a second after the big bang," he told afp. we invite all our readers to share with us their views and comments about this article.

(ap photo/cern) scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the higgs boson anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research , have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super- symmetry " where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern . scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. copyright 2012 the associated press. all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. 0 share to facebook physorg.com on fb tweet physorg.com on twitter reddit delicious yahoo! bookmarks rss qr code view popular send feedback to editors 5 /5 (12 votes) 1 2 3 4 5

T	beth's blog: physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe
C	signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the higgs boson, a key to understanding why there is diversity and life in the universe. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern, the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider, the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." read more

T	fun with physics' god-like particles - sgvtribune.com
C	somewhat to the regret of his fellow scientists, a physicist dubbed a subatomic particle that once existed only in theory as the "god particle," because without it the physical universe - stars, planets, us - wouldn't exist. the higgs boson - named for university of edinburgh professor peter higgs, one of the six physicists who postulated the particle's existence in 1964 - endows other basic particles, protons, neutrons, electrons, etc., with mass. scientists compare the process of an object acquiring size and weight to passing through molasses - the "higgs field." actually proving its existence proved considerably more difficult. the method chosen involved a 17-mile circular tunnel called the large hadron collider, operated by cern, the european center for nuclear research in geneva. the physicists would send particles rocketing around the collider at high speeds until the particles collided, and then the scientists would study the debris for traces of the higgs boson. to show how painstaking this was, joe incandela, the american physicist who led one of the two teams, said out of some 500 trillions collisions only several dozen produced "events" that could be studied. advanced physics doesn't come cheaply or easily. this discovery took two years, cost $110 billion and the work of 6,000 physicists. the scientists detected a faint glimmer of what might be the higgs boson last winter and began honing in on the fleeting, advertisement microscopic sightings of what may or may not have been the sought-after particle. cern's director, rolf heuer, was at first reluctant to go beyond saying they had found "a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." but wednesday in geneva, he told physicists gathered there and at webcam viewing stations around the world, "i think we have it." this was greeted with standing ovations, but perhaps no one welcomed his announcement more than dr. higgs, now 83, who was there in geneva for the celebration. the discovery vindicated the standard model, the predictive theory of particle physics - but, like so many breakthroughs, it raises as many questions as it answers. as one elated scientist put it, now the fun begins. scripps howard news service copyright 2012 san gabriel valley tribune. all rights reserved. return to top reading rss feed ... rss feed widget ? readers: let us know what you think of the new commenting system copyright | privacy policy | info | subscriber services | site map | rss | autotrader.com partner | find san gabriel jobs | mng corporate site map for more local southern california news: copyright ? los angeles newspaper group privacy policy | terms of use | mng corporate site map | copyright

T	cern finds higgs-like (god) particle; uw scientists, up late, celebrate discovery | kplu news for seattle and the northwest
C	the surprising places you might find liquor in washington why $5,000 was thrown out the window of a seattle hotel 'catch a killer' - seattle pd launches newsy site to fight crime production manager/ jazz & blues host gordon watts, a physics professor at uw, shared the news of the likely discovery of the higgs boson announced in the evidence presented by cern tonight. a physicist explains the atlas experiment on a board at the european center for nuclear research, cern, outside geneva, switzerland in 2011. the illustration shows what the long-presumed higgs boson particle is thought to look like. a scientist of the european organization for nuclear research, cern, gestures in the alice experiment control room at their headquarters outside geneva, switzerland, in 2010. back then, cern was downplaying rumors of a discovery. a university of washington physics professor with connection to the experiments at the cern large hadron collider said a higgs-like particle has been discovered. "we have discovered something ... and quite frankly i can't see how it can be anything other than the higgs but we need scientific proof to close that door," said gordon watts, a physics professor at uw, at a tavern-based seminar tonight in lower queen anne with nearly 150 colleagues and science aficionados. "we just do not have the data yet to determine what the flavor of higgs it is that we see. "i am positive. my gut tells me that is what this is." university of washington scientists, colleagues and friends met for a pre-announcement 'seminar' near the pacific science center in seattle. at the event, several physicists explained the background of the atlas detector at the large hadron collider at cern in switzerland in the quest for the higgs boson. the uw played a significant role in the atlas detector's development and work, the university said announcing the late night event. "this is a huge milestone. we've never been able before to say that we have a new particle here," watts said. "from the point of view of understanding how the universe works, this is huge." npr reports: teams of scientists using the large hadron collider at the european organization for nuclear research, or cern, announced in geneva this morning that they have detected evidence of a new subatomic particle that bears the hallmarks of the elusive and highly sought after higgs boson. in layman's terms, the higgs is referred to as the "god particle" because the field it produces gives atoms its mass. were it not for the higgs, the world we know would be completely different - there would be no chemistry, no architecture, no us. it would be a massless mess of aimless particles running around at light speed. our understanding of the universe is about to change? the atlas and cms experiments at cern today presented their latest results in the search for the long-sought higgs boson. both experiments see strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (gev). the experiments found hints of the new particle by analysing trillions of proton-proton collisions from the large hadron collider (lhc) in 2011 and 2012. the standard model of particle physics predicts that a higgs boson would decay into different particles - which the lhc experiments then detect. a proton-proton collision event in the cms experiment producing two high-energy photons (red towers). this is what we would expect to see from the decay of a higgs boson but it is also consistent with background standard model physics processes. ? cern 2012 the uw explained that, led by professors henry lubatti in physics and colin daly in mechanical engineering, uw professors helped design and fabricate nearly 90,000 tubes that are key to the workings of the atlas detector. atlas is one of six particle physics experiments that are part of the collider at cern. "it looks like we've caught the tail of a higgs. let's just make sure the rest of the animal looks like we thought it would," watts said. news of the discovery was apparently released accidently hours before the announcement by cern. the telegraph reports : in the short film accidentally published by the lab yesterday spokesman joe incandela is seen describing how physicists at the large hadron collider had "observed a new particle". it came as scientists gathered in geneva ahead of the most heavily anticipated announcement yet on the hunt for the higgs boson, which takes place today. among the audience will be peter higgs, the edinburgh professor who first proposed the existence of the mysterious particle almost 50 years ago. rumours have been rife that scientists hunting the higgs will announce a new discovery, and the video appeared to confirm the finding of a particle matching its description. the higgs boson is a cornerstone of modern physics despite never being seen, the new york times explains . it is the last missing part of the standard model, a suite of equations that has held sway as the law of the cosmos for the last 35 years, and explains why things in the universe have mass. physicists have been eager to finish the edifice, rule the higgs either in or out and then use that information to form deeper theories that could explain, for example, why the universe is made of matter and not antimatter, or what constitutes the dark matter and dark energy that rule the larger universe. the cosmic log at msnbc adds: the higgs particle, and its associated field, were hypothesized back in the 1960s by british physicist peter higgs and others to fill a weird gap in the standard model, one of physics' most successful theories. the model as it stood had no mechanism to explain why some particles are massless (such as the photon, which is the quantum bit for light and other types of electromagnetic radiation), while other particles have varying degrees of mass (such as the w and z bosons, which play a part in the weak nuclear force). by rights, all particles should be without mass and zipping around freely.

C	physicists find elusive particle seen as key to universe aspen, colo. - signaling a likely end to one of the longest, most expensive searches in the history of science, physicists said wednesday that they had discovered a new subatomic particle that looks for all the world like the peter wynn thompson for the new york times proton collisions from the search. like omar sharif materializing out of the shimmering desert as a man on a camel in "lawrence of arabia," the elusive boson has been coming slowly into view since last winter, as the first signals of its existence grew until they practically jumped off the chart. "i think we have it," said rolf-dieter heuer, the director general of cern , the multinational research center headquartered in geneva. the agency is home to the large hadron collider , the immense particle accelerator that produced the new data by colliding protons. the findings were announced by two separate teams. dr. heuer called the discovery "a historic milestone." he and others said that it was too soon to know for sure, however, whether the new particle is the one predicted by the standard model, the theory that has ruled physics for the last half-century. the particle is predicted to imbue elementary particles with mass. it may be an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, beyond the standard model, about the nature of reality. for now, some physicists are simply calling it a "higgslike" particle. "it's something that may, in the end, be one of the biggest observations of any new phenomena in our field in the last 30 or 40 years," said joe incandela, a physicist of the university of california, santa barbara, and a spokesman for one of the two groups reporting new data on wednesday. here at the aspen center for physics, a retreat for scientists, bleary-eyed physicists drank champagne in the wee hours as word arrived via webcast from cern. it was a scene duplicated in melbourne, australia, where physicists had gathered for a major conference, as well as in los angeles, chicago, princeton, new york, london and beyond - everywhere that members of a curious species have dedicated their lives and fortunes to the search for their origins in a dark universe. in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern, where some attendees noted a rock-concert ambience. peter higgs, the university of edinburgh theorist for whom the boson is named, entered the meeting to a sustained ovation. confirmation of the higgs boson or something very much like it would constitute a rendezvous with destiny for a generation of physicists who have believed in the boson for half a century without ever seeing it. the finding affirms a grand view of a universe described by simple and elegant and symmetrical laws - but one in which everything interesting, like ourselves, results from flaws or breaks in that symmetry. according to the standard model, the higgs boson is the only manifestation of an invisible force field, a cosmic molasses that permeates space and imbues elementary particles with mass. particles wading through the field gain heft the way a bill going through congress attracts riders and amendments, becoming ever more ponderous. without the higgs field, as it is known, or something like it, all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light, flowing through our hands like moonlight. there would be neither atoms nor life. physicists said that they would probably be studying the new particle for years. any deviations from the simplest version predicted by current theory - and there are hints of some already - could begin to answer questions left hanging by the standard model. for example, what is the dark matter that provides the gravitational scaffolding of galaxies? and why is the universe made of matter instead of antimatter? "if the boson really is not acting standard, then that will imply that there is more to the story - more particles, maybe more forces around the corner," neal weiner, a theorist at new york university, wrote in an e-mail. "what that would be is anyone's guess at the moment." wednesday's announcement was also an impressive opening act for the large hadron collider, the world's biggest physics machine, which cost $10 billion to build and began operating only two years ago. it is still running at only half-power. physicists had been icing the champagne ever since last december. two teams of about 3,000 physicists each - one named atlas, led by fabiola gianotti, and the other cms, led by dr. incandela - operate giant detectors in the collider, sorting the debris from the primordial fireballs left after proton collisions. last winter, they both reported hints of the same particle. they were not able, however, to rule out the possibility that it was a statistical fluke. since then, the collider has more than doubled the number of collisions it has recorded. the results announced wednesday capped two weeks of feverish speculation and internet buzz as the physicists, who had been sworn to secrecy, did a breakneck analysis of about 800 trillion proton-proton collisions over the last two years. up until last weekend, physicists at the agency were saying that they themselves did not know what the outcome would be. expectations soared when it was learned that the five surviving originators of the higgs boson theory had been invited to the cern news conference. the december signal was no fluke, the scientists said wednesday. the new particle has a mass of about 125.3 billion electron volts, as measured by the cms group, and 126 billion according to atlas. both groups said that the likelihood that their signal was a result of a chance fluctuation was less than one chance in 3.5 million, "five sigma," which is the gold standard in physics for a discovery. on that basis, dr. heuer said that he had decided only on tuesday afternoon to call the higgs result a "discovery." he said, "i know the science, and as director general i can stick out my neck." dr. incandela's and dr. gianotti's presentations were repeatedly interrupted by applause as they showed slide after slide of data presented in graphs with bumps rising like mountains from the sea. dr. gianotti noted that the mass of the putative higgs, apparently one of the heaviest subatomic particles, made it easy to study its many behaviors. "thanks, nature," she said. gerald guralnik, one of the founders of the higgs theory, said he was glad to be at a physics meeting "where there is applause, like a football game." asked to comment after the announcements, dr. higgs seemed overwhelmed. "for me, it's really an incredible thing that's happened in my lifetime," he said. dr. higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who in 1964 invented what came to be known as the higgs field. the others were tom kibble of imperial college, london; carl hagen of the university of rochester; dr. guralnik of brown university; and fran?ois englert and robert brout, both of universit? libre de bruxelles. one implication of their theory was that this cosmic molasses, normally invisible, would produce its own quantum particle if hit hard enough with the right amount of energy. the particle would be fragile and fall apart within a millionth of a second in a dozen possible ways, depending upon its own mass. unfortunately, the theory did not describe how much this particle should weigh, which is what made it so hard to find, eluding researchers at a succession of particle accelerators, including the large electron positron collider at cern, which closed down in 2000, and the tevatron at the fermi national accelerator laboratory, or fermilab, in batavia, ill., which shut down last year. along the way the higgs boson achieved a notoriety rare in abstract physics. to the eternal dismay of his colleagues, leon lederman, the former director of fermilab, called it the "god particle," in his book of the same name, written with dick teresi. (he later said that he had wanted to call it the "goddamn particle.") finding the missing boson was one of the main goals of the large hadron collider. both dr. heuer and dr. gianotti said they had not expected the search to succeed so quickly. so far, the physicists admit, they know little about their new boson. the cern results are mostly based on measurements of two or three of the dozen different ways, or "channels," by which a higgs boson could be produced and then decay. there are hints, but only hints so far, that some of the channels are overproducing the boson while others might be underproducing it, clues that maybe there is more at work here than the standard model would predict. "this could be the first in a ring of discoveries," said guido tonelli of cern. in an e-mail, maria spiropulu, a professor at the california institute of technology who works with the cms team of physicists, said: "i personally do not want it to be standard model anything - i don't want it to be simple or symmetric or as predicted. i want us all to have been dealt a complex hand that will send me (and all of us) in a (good) loop for a long time." nima arkani-hamed, a physicist at the institute for advanced study in princeton, said: "it's a triumphant day for fundamental physics. now some fun begins." a version of this article appeared in print on july 5, 2012, on page

C	home ? higgs boson: statistical life-line for an elusive particle the news about the' discovery' of a particle that resembles higgs boson or so-called god particle by cern, the european organization for nuclear research, stirred up immense excitement in the scientific community this week, which in turn developed into a world-wide frenzy, when the media glorified the event while mischievously shadowing a multitude of depressing news from both political and economic realms. the attraction of the journalists to the news, more or less, is on a par with the irresistible tendency of tom cruise's ex-wives to high heel shoes - after respective, acrimonious divorces, of course. the collective reaction from the european physicists generated the impression that the 'particle' that cern discovered was, in fact, higgs boson. the press release from cern, however, was clearly exercised caution without going that far: "the atlas and cms experiments at cern today presented their latest results in the search for the long-sought higgs boson. both experiments see strong indications for the presence of a new particle, which could be the higgs boson, in the mass region around 126 gigaelectronvolts (gev)." then cern went on to explain the statistical significance of the result:" both atlas and cms gave the level of significance of the result as 5 sigma on the scale that particle physicists use to describe the certainty of a discovery. one sigma means the results could be random fluctuations in the data, 3 sigma counts as an observation and a 5-sigma result is a discovery." for those who are not statisticians, sigma (?) represents the standard deviation - tendency of data to be away from the mean or base value on either side of it. if the data in question lies within five of those values around the mean, it is called 5 sigma level of certainty and the probability of the particular observation being a fluke is one in few millions. cern did very little to clear the fog of uncertainty when it pointed out that the results were preliminary, as the results of the data in 2012 were still under analysis. in short, the physicists at the organization were still reluctant to declare that they actually found higgs boson; moreover, they were hesitant to say that the costly-pursuit of the elusive particle was well and truly over. it is clear that cern does not want a repeat of embarrassing mistake that they made while dealing with neutrinos - the announcement of the speed of light of being broken which turned out to be erroneous, caused by faulty wires. professor peter higgs, aged 83, the scottish physicist who came up with the hypothesis of higgs boson in 1964, was at cern when the announcement was made. his reaction, however, was much more measured than that of his younger followers: he simply said, "it is very nice to be right sometimes." when asked about his eligibility for the nobel prize, professor higgs said that the nobel committee would be forced to change the rules before making that decision, as he was one of the six physicists who collectively came up with the concept - noble prize is normally given to a maximum of three individuals. professor higgs, meanwhile, in an interview with a national newspaper, said that he had no idea about the practical applications of the higgs boson. if the particle discovered by cern is higgs boson, it is the last piece of jigsaw that explains the interaction among sub-atomic particles and its relation to four fundamental forces in the universe, i.e., electromagnetic force, gravitational force plus strong and weak nuclear forces, the standard model. according to the standard model, sub atomic particles started roaming around what was then universe, almost at the speed of light after the 'beginning' - the big bang. immediately after the big bang - a trillionth of a second later, to be precise - according to the model, these particles started interacting with a field called higgs field which had permeated the universe by then, consisting of particles known as higgs bosons. the interaction accounts for the accumulation of mass by these particles. the particles were known as quarks - top, bottom, up, down, charm, strange - and leptons such as electrons. since the accumulation of mass was not uniform, they appeared to have gained different masses. as a result, they were subjected to the drag caused by higgs field, which in turn affected their respective speeds: the heavier the particle, the slower the speed. however, there were some particles which did not gain any mass at all, despite going through the same process - photons, for instance. as a close analogy, the animation that i created is a desert full of sand dunes and boulders of different sizes: the desert represents the higgs field; each sand grain is a higgs boson; the boulders are the sub-atomic particles which started moving around at the speed of light, shortly after the big bang and the formation of the higgs field respectively. the tendency of heavier boulders being bogged down in sand, illustrates the fate of heavy sub-atomic particles in the higgs field. in order to create the conditions conducive for the higgs bosons, the physicists at cern sent two high-speed beams of protons through an underground tunnel, which lies beneath swiss-french border, in opposite directions. upon collision, they believed, higgs boson would be produced, in addition to a catalogue of other particles. since this particular boson was short-lived, the scientists had been compelled to analyse the particles that it had spontaneously decayed into, for the evidence - the scenario that rules out the possibility of it being observed directly. therefore, the physicists have to make sure that the by-products were not created by the collisions of other particles inside lhc - large hadron collider - at cern. the challenges for the physicists do not suddenly disappear, even if the missing piece of the standard model, the higgs boson, is found with absolute certainty, though. the standard model - which is far from perfect itself - has, for instance, failed to account for the presence of dark energy in the universe. in these circumstances, it will be quite strange if physicists stubbornly embrace this particular model as the ultimate answer to their life-long quest for finding the origin of the universe, while knowing very well that all the major theories have been evolving for centuries. in that context, it is not an embarrassment to welcome the uncertainty of a scientific result no matter how long they have been at it. nor is it a sign of weakness to admit human error while dealing with experiments of this magnitude - at the first available opportunity. therefore, the use of words like 'discovery' and 'new particle' by cern is admirable, as going over the top for the sake of publicity is a short-cut to losing the credibility. history is full of folks from whom the scientists can draw inspiration, in the event of facing such a scenario. the economist, john maynard keynes, for instance, when challenged for being inconsistent by a critic in public, famously responded by saying, "when facts change, i change my mind. what do you do, sir?" ralph waldo emerson, the famous american thinker, branded consistency as a terror and equated it to the reverence for the past. lines and paragraphs break automatically. pairs of tags will be styled as a block that indicates a quotation. web page addresses and e-mail addresses turn into links automatically. lines and paragraphs break automatically. pairs of asiantribune.com. all rights reserved. the information contained in the

C	scientists hunting the elusive subatomic 'higgs' particle will unveil findings on wednesday(04-july-2012) that take them nearer to understanding how the big bang at the dawn of time gave rise to stars, planets and even life. physicists who have been smashing particles together near light-speed at the cern laboratory near geneva have already seen tantalising glimpses of the "higgs boson", the missing piece of the fundamental theory of physics known as the standard model. the world of science now awaits a mass of evidence big enough to be deemed a formal discovery. the secrecy surrounding wednesday's announcement has fuelled speculation that nearly 40 years of research have reached a climax. data harvested from cern's large hadron collider, the biggest particle accelerator in the world, could also shed light on the make-up of the poorly understood 'dark matter' and "dark energy" that make up 96 percent of the universe. it may even point the way to research into the possibility of parallel universes. cern is planning to beam the announcement live around the world to a physics conference in melbourne, australia. related events are planned in countries involved in the project, including britain. the unusual level of stage management has fuelled the sense that big news is on the cards. on monday, us physicists said they had found the strongest evidence yet of the existence of the higgs in a mass of data collected from the now-mothballed tevatron particle accelerator, run by the fermi national accelerator lab outside chicago. "it will be interesting to see how it lines up with cern's results on wednesday," said cern spokesman james gillies. some scientists working on the project have told reuters they expect the unveiling of a formal discovery while others expect it to fall just short. with thousands of physicists involved, divided into two separate teams called atlas and cms, cern insists the full picture will not be clear to anyone until a seminar shortly before wednesday's announcement. "even cern's director general won't know much before the seminar reveals the exact results," said pauline gagnon, a canadian particle physicist working on atlas. "they are being finalised at the last minute after much scrutiny." the higgs particle, although crucial for understanding how the universe was formed, remains theoretical. it is the last undiscovered piece of the standard model that describes the fundamental make-up of the universe. the model is for physicists what the theory of evolution is for biologists. scientists say the existence of dark matter and dark energy suggests the standard model, if validated by a higgs discovery, is just the first layer of a more complex theory that includes the vast bulk of the universe that is now poorly understood. "the standard model has a few major flaws; the higgs boson discovery would only fix one of them," said gagnon.

C	sacramento - a man is in jail after a traffic stop turned into assault against ... las vegas - it took only 31 seconds for chad mendes to end cody mckenzie in ufc ... jason vargas tossed his first complete game of the season and the seattle ... by dan vergano, usa today physicists welcomed july fourth with intellectual fireworks, announcing "preliminary" results pointing to the discovery of the long-sought "god particle." formally known as the higgs boson, it was detected in experiments at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) lab near geneva. for the non-scientists who wonder what a higgs boson is, usa today distilled explanations from a number of physicists, including paul padley of rice university, part of one of the discovery teams: q: so what is a higgs boson? a: a tiny subatomic particle that apparently weighs about 130 times as much as an atom of hydrogen, the lightest gas. q: what does it do? a: simply put, the higgs particle interacts with other subatomic particles that are building blocks of atoms in a way that slows them down. it's the reason that matter in the universe has mass. mass gives the particles inertia, or resistance to being moved faster. q: what is a simple analogy that describes this effect? a: compare higgs bosons to groupies mobbing a celebrity. the other particles are the celebrities, desperately trying to move but slowed by autograph-seekers. higgs bosons don't have pens, but the attention they give to the other particles slows them, creating inertia. q: why did physicists think this likely had to exist? a: physicists look to particles to explain forces in the universe. in the physicists' theories, electromagnetic and nuclear forces don't need particles with mass to work. but the particles do have mass, so we need an explanation for why. in 1964, peter higgs of scotland's university of edinburgh and other physicists theorized the higgs boson was the culprit. q: how did they make this discovery? essentially, two teams collected data in separate experiments that smashed together millions of subatomic particles called protons to see what pieces emerged from the smash-ups. the particle reported on wednesday fell to pieces in ways predicted by higgs and other physicists. q: how sure are they that this is the higgs boson?

T	the higgs boson: why you should care about the god particle. and, sadly, why you don't. - worldnews.com
C	ted talker, likes to call herself a science evangelist, and her passion and expertise at science education is unparalleled. so this week, with the announcement about the discovery of teh ibtimesuk cern, the european organization for nuclear research made a ground-breaking announcement that scientists at the large hadron collider (lhc) have discovered a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the long-sought higgs boson. known as the elusive "god particle", as it gives mass to all other particles in the universe. the search for the higgs boson has been going on for decades at a cost of billions of pounds. scientists have now announced they have seen the best evidence yet that it exists. here professor john ellis, explained what it is. "what it is? it's the last piece in the 'standard model.' the standard model describes all the matter that we can see in the universe, you, me, the planet, the stars, galaxies, all that matter is described by the standard model. that description only makes sense if a higgs boson exists or something very similar to it." here is the large hadron collider in the cern underground lab which was used to hunt the higgs boson since 1984. professor ellis then explains just what a ground-breaking discovery this is. "so it's very exciting that finally, after so many years of looking and waiting and searching, we may finally discover the missing link that really makes our description of the matter in the universe sensible. maybe it's the higgs boson, maybe it's not higgs boson, but finally, i think, we gonna start seeing the boson." written and presented by ann salter cip1881 higgs boson: scientists 99.999% sure 'god particle' has been found scientists believe they have captured the elusive "god particle" that gives matter mass and holds the physical fabric of the universe together. the historic announcement came in a progress report from the large hadron collider particle accelerator. professor john womersley, chief executive of the science and technology facilities council, told reporters at a briefing in london: "they have discovered a particle consistent with the higgs boson. "discovery is the important word. that is confirmed. it's a momentous day for science." scientists say it is a 5 sigma result which means they are 99.999% sure they have found a new particle. finding the higgs plugs a gaping hole in the standard model, the theory that describes all the particles, forces and interactions that make up the universe. if the particle was shown not to exist, it would have meant tearing up the standard model and going back to the drawing board. the cern laboratory appeared to have let slip its biggest breakthrough in a generation after appearing to announce the discovery of a new particle in an online video overnight. in the short film accidentally published by the lab yesterday spokesman joe incandela is seen describing how physicists at the large hadron collider had "observed a new particle". www.telegraph.co.uk linktv scientists at the cern research centre in switzerland welcome the news that a new subatomic particle could be the higgs boson, the basic building block of the universe. spokesman for one of the two teams hunting for the higgs particle, joe incandela, makes the announcement. footage courtesy of reuters. linktv news: news.linktv.org facebook www.facebook.com twitter: www.twitter.com revillusi0nz cern scientist announces higgs boson 'god particle' discovery www.youtube.com god particle is 'found': scientists at cern expected to announce on wednesday higgs boson particle has been discovered read more: www.dailymail.co.uk confirmed: cern discovers new particle likely to be the higgs boson www.youtube.com copyright disclaimer under section 107 of the copyright act 1976: allowance is made for 'fair use' for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. non-profit, educational or personal use tips the balance in favor of fair use. all copyrights go to their rightful owner no infringement intended. mrnchoudhury 4 july 2012 bbc news [the bbc did not refer to the 'god particle' -

the key is here] to reveal their inner workings. this is about a very basic quest. to understand what the universe is made of how from empty space we get the planets and us [amazing - there is still no unified theory of physics...] this involves digging into atoms, deeper and deeper to reveal the incredibly small parts inside them so tiny it's not clear how they have any kind of substance. that's where the higgs boson comes in - a particle that acts like glue [beautiful] giving other particles mass. professor brian cox - "it's like saying we want to explore that ocean but we don't know where the land is we want to explore. we've now slatester higgs boson, aka the "god particle," is trending as physicists at the cern, which operates the large hadron collider in switzerland, announced they may have finally glimpsed the elusive elemental particle critical to our understanding of how the universe works. named after physicist peter higgs, the subatomic particle is seen as the lynchpin to explain what gives mass and gravity to all other particles, thus allowing matter to interact the way we observe it. the hunt for higgs boson has been going on for decades. scientists at the cern say the latest evidence is not a definitive discovery but that the data is "exciting" and suggests that with further statistical analysis, they should know within a year if the theoretical higgs boson actually exists. gigitv1 god particle why the truth about the higgs boson is still probably stranger than fiction thoughts 'the god particle': the higgs boson thoughts higgs boson: new data said to narrow hunt for 'god' particle thoughts scientists may have observed elusive higgs boson "god particle" thoughts physicists at cern, the european organisation for nuclear research, have announced new evidence hinting towards although not quite confirming -

a property which allows them to bind together and form stars and planets rather than whizzing around the universe at the speed of light. prof higgs, 83, who travelled to switerland to witness the landmark announcement first-hand, was visibly moved as the presentation was rounded off to tumultuous applause from a wildly excited audience, some of whom had waited overnight to secure their seats. choking back tears, he said: "i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement. it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime." his response was characteristically modest. professor higgs has repeatedly resisted requests for interviews and frequentnews cern scientists reporting at conferences in the uk and geneva claim the discovery of a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. the particle has been the subject of a 45-year hunt to explain how matter attains its mass. cms, one of the two higgs-hunting experiments at the large hadron collider, has reached a level of certainty worthy of a "discovery". the other experiment, atlas, has yet to report its results. the team claimed they had seen a "bump" in their data corresponding to a particle weighing in at 125.3 gigaelectronvolts (gev) - about 133 times heavier than the proton at the heart of every atom. indications are strong, but it remains to be seen whether the particle the team reports is in fact the higgs - those answers will certainly not come on wednesday. the result announced at cern, home of the lhc in geneva, was met with applause. the cms team claimed that by combining two of its data sets, the researchers had attained a confidence level just at the "five-sigma" point - about a one-in-3.5 million chance that the signal they see would appear if there were no higgs particle. however, a full combination of the cms data brings that number just back to 4.9 sigma - a one-in-2 million chance. slatester watch: youtube.com slatev.com follow twitter.com facebook.com could this be the week scientists finally prove the existence of the one true god particle? lead researchers at cern will reportedly hold a press conference this week to confirm the existence of the elusive higgs boson particle. the higgs boson particle is thought to give elementary particles like quarks and electrons mass, and it's confirmed existence may lead to a reevaluation of many theorems in the field of physics. rumor has it scientists are 99.99-percent sure of their discovery, which could be the biggest science news in decades. until the press conference on july 4th, we'll have to wait to see if the god particle has finally been scientifically proven, or if believing in it's existence remains just a scientific act of faith. russiatoday read more on.rt.com two teams of scientists at cern have confirmed the discovery of a new subatomic particle, which may well be the elusive higgs boson, also known as "the god particle".

school united states. incorporated as the "collegiate school," the institution traces its roots to 17th-century clergymen who sought to establish a college to train british east india company. in 1861, the graduate school of arts and sciences became the first u.s. school to award the phd. yale became a founding member of the 12 now exist and two more are planned. yale employs over 1,100 faculty to teach and advise about 5,300 undergraduate and 6,100 graduate and professional students. almost all tenured professors teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually. endowment, the second-largest of any academic institution. yale libraries hold 12.5 million volumes in more than two dozen libraries. 49 affiliated with the university as students, faculty, and staff. yale has produced many notable alumni, including five harvard university share a strong athletic rivalry, which traditionally culminates in harvard-yale regatta. the official color of the university and its athletic teams is yale blue . history origins yale traces its beginnings to "an act for liberty to erect a collegiate school", passed by the general court of the colony of connecticut on october 9, 1701 in an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for connecticut. soon thereafter, a group of ten congregationalist ministers: samuel andrew, thomas buckingham, israel chauncy, samuel mather, james noyes, noadiah russell, joseph webb and timothy woodbridge, all of whom were alumni of harvard, met in the study of reverend branford, connecticut, to pool their books to form the school's first library. the group, led by james pierpont , is now known as "the founders". originally called the new haven, connecticut. meanwhile, a rift was forming at harvard between its sixth president increase mather and the rest of the harvard clergy, whom mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in church polity . the feud caused the mathers to champion the success of the collegiate school in the hope that it would maintain the gurdon saltonstall, cotton mather contacted a successful businessman in wales named elihu yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. through the persuasion of jeremiah dummer , yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in india as a representative of the east india company , donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than ?560, a substantial sum at the time. yale also donated 417 books and a portrait of king george i . cotton mather suggested that the school change its name to in gratitude to its benefactor, and to increase the chances that he would give the college another large donation or bequest. elihu yale was away in india when the news of the school's name change reached his home in wrexham , wales, a trip from which he never returned. while he did ultimately leave his fortunes to the "collegiate school within his majesties colony of connecticot" , the institution was never able to successfully lay claim to it. curriculum yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period-the enlightenment-thanks to the religious and scientific interests of presidents ezra stiles. they were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at yale, while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, "irrelevance" of curricula, desperate need for endowment, and fights with the connecticut legislature. serious american students of theology and divinity, particularly in new england, regarded ezra stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study hebrew (in contrast to harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the hebrew words "urim" and "thummim" on the yale seal. stiles' greatest challenge occurred in july 1779 when hostile british forces occupied new haven and threatened to raze the college. fortunately, yale graduate edmund fanning , secretary to the british general in command of the occupation, interceded and the college was saved. fanning later was granted an honorary degree directed studies program was founded for 125 first-year students as an interdisciplinary course encompassing great works of western thought. students as the only college in connecticut, yale educated the sons of the elite. offenses for which students were punished included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. during the period, harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while yale had youth and zeal on its side. the emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. the first such organizations were debating societies: brothers in unity in 1768. 19th century the yale report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. unlike higher education in europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states. in the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. at the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. the yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. at the same time, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track. in the decentralized environment of higher education in the united states, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical. at the same time a group of professors at yale and new haven congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the victorian culture. they concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without. perhaps the most well-remembered teacher was william graham sumner , professor from 1872 to 1909. he taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. he bested president noah porter , who disliked social science and wanted yale to lock into its traditions of classical education, 1879-81. porter objected to sumner's use of a textbook by herbert spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might intellectually, morally, and religiously harm students. nathan hale (yale 1773) was the prototype of the yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who regretted he had but one life to lose for his country. western painter frederic remington (yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the wild west. the fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century yale man frank merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor frank stover in the novel stover at yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself. princeton, yale students rejected elite british concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely american, such as football. the harvard-yale football rivalry began in 1875. between 1892, when harvard and yale met in the first intercollegiate debate, and 1909, the year of the first triangular debate of harvard, yale, and princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. there even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. one reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. in addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart. in 1909-10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905-06 to solve the problem of serious injuries. there was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of harvard, yale, and princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. president arthur hadley of yale, a. lawrence lowell of harvard, and woodrow wilson of princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the intercollegiate athletic association. the big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries. yale school of fine arts (1869). in 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of yale school of management (1976). it would also reorganize its relationship with the sheffield scientific school. noah porter, moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. during an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. many of porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. levesque argues porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. 20th century behavioral sciences between 1925 and 1940, philanthropic foundations, especially ones connected with the rockefellers, contributed about $7 million to support the yale institute of human relations and the affiliated yerkes laboratories of primate biology. the money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to "improve mankind" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. the behavioral scientists at yale, led by president robert m. yerkes, tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control, sexual and social behavior. for example, yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences. biology slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. yale proved important as a site for this research. the leaders of these groups were g. evelyn hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. all produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; pickford's and hutchinson's were not. pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research. yale medical school as its dean from 1920 to 1935. an innovative, even maverick, leader, he not only kept the school from going under but also turned it into a first-class research institution. dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in germany, he was equally fervent about "social medicine" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. he established the "yale system" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level yale school of nursing and the psychiatry department, built numerous new buildings, and accomplished much more. progress toward his plans for an institute of human relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-semitic colleagues drove him to resign. faculty before world war ii, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; yale was no exception. by 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions. history and american studies the american studies program reflected the worldwide anti-communist ideological struggle. norman holmes pearson , who worked for the office of strategic studies in london during world war ii, returned to yale and headed the new american studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of american civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose. also during the 1940s and 1950s, wyoming millionaire william r. coe made large contributions to the american studies programs at yale university and at the university of wyoming. coe was concerned to celebrate the 'values' of the western united states in order to meet the "threat of communism." women women studied at yale university as early as 1876, in graduate-level programs at the vassar college about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. vassar, then all-female, declined the invitation. both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969. amy solomon was the first woman to register as a yale undergraduate; she was also the first woman at yale to join an undergraduate society, st. anthony hall . a decade into co-education, rampant student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit alexander v. yale . while unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of yale's grievance board and the yale women's center. in march 2011 a title ix complaint was filed against yale. class yale, like other ivy league schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed artificially to increase the proportion of white protestants of notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus), and was one of the last of the ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970. town-gown relations yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. under president levin, yale has financially supported many of new haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy. yale in the 21st century in 2007, yale president rick levin characterized yale's institutional priorities: "first, among the nation's finest research universities, yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in yale college, we are committed to the education of leaders." the boston globe wrote that "if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's yale." george w. bush, and major-party nominees during this period include jerry brown (1976, 1980, 1992). several explanations have been offered for yale's representation in national elections since the end of the vietnam war. various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of reverend duke university , stated: "we do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of gaddis smith notes "an ethos of organized activity" at yale during the 20th century that led john kerry to lead the george pataki the conservative party, and joseph lieberman to manage the camille paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: "it has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school." cnn suggests that george w. bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the "son and grandson of alumni," and for a "member of a politically influential family." james fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others. michael dukakis for having "foreign-policy views born in harvard yard's boutique." when challenged on the distinction between dukakis's harvard connection and his own yale background, he said that, unlike harvard, yale's reputation was "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, i don't think, in the yale situation, any symbolism in it" and said yale did not share harvard's reputation for "liberalism and elitism". in 2004, howard dean stated, "in some ways, i consider myself separate from the other three (yale) candidates of 2004. yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. my class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit african americans. it was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation". tony blair picked yale as one location - the others are britain's tony blair faith foundation's united states faith and globalization initiative. as of 2009, former mexican president yale center for the study of globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, "debating globalization". as of 2009, former presidential candidate and dnc chair howard dean teaches a residential college seminar, "understanding politics and politicians." also, in 2009, an alliance was formed between yale, university college london and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care-a growing field known as translational medicine. president richard levin noted that yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but "no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with ucl." richard c. levin is one of the highest paid university presidents in the united states with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million. the yale provost's office has launched several women into prominent university presidencies. in 1977, hanna holborn gray was appointed acting president of yale from this position, and went on to become president of the university of chicago , the first woman to be full president of a major university. in 1994, yale provost wellesley college . in 2008, provost andrew hamilton was confirmed to be the vice chancellor of the university of oxford. former dean of yale college duke university. staff and labor unions much of yale university's staff, including most maintenance staff, dining hall employees, and administrative staff, are unionized. clerical and technical employees are represented by local 34 of 1199 seiu. in addition to these unions, officers of the yale university police department are members of the yale police benevolent association, which affiliated in 2005 with the connecticut organization for public safety employees. finally, yale security officers voted to join the international union of security, police and fire professionals of america afscme; the yale administration contested the election. yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes. there have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and the new york times wrote that yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the u.s. yale's unusually large endowment exacerbates the tension over wages. moreover, yale has been accused of failing to treat workers with respect. in a 2003 strike, however, the university claimed that more union employees were working than striking. professor david graeber was 'retired' after he came to the defense of a student who was involved in campus labor issues. yale golf course and nature preserves in rural connecticut and collegiate gothic campus as well as for several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: eero saarinen's ingalls rink and ezra stiles and morse colleges, and art & architecture building. yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along hillhouse avenue , which was considered the most beautiful street in america by charles dickens when he visited the united states in the 1840s. many of yale's buildings were constructed in the collegiate gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by edward s. harkness stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. similarly, the decorative frieze s on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the law school), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. the architect, james gamble rogers , faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, deliberately breaking their middle ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. in fact, the buildings merely simulate middle ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. one exception is harkness tower , tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. it was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the yale memorial carillon . other examples of the gothic (also called neo-gothic and collegiate gothic) style are on sheffield scientific school (the engineering and sciences school at yale until 1956) and elements of silliman college , the largest residential college. the oldest building on campus, georgian style. georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include davenport college, except the latter's east, york street fa?ade, which was constructed in the skidmore, owings, and merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. it is located near the center of the university in beinecke plaza ". the library's six-story above-ground tower of book stacks is surrounded by a windowless rectangular building with walls made of translucent vermont marble, which transmit subdued lighting to the interior and provide protection from direct light, while glowing from within after dark. isamu noguchi are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube). ingalls rink at yale and the newest residential colleges of ezra stiles and morse. these latter were modelled after the medieval italian hilltown of san gimignano - a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers. these tower forms at yale act in counterpoint to the college's many gothic spires and georgian cupolas. yale's office of sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at yale. yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. as part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges. eleven campus buildings are candidates for leed design and certification. yale sustainable food project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls. yale was listed as a campus sustainability leader on the sustainable endowments institute's college sustainability report card 2008, and received a "b+" grade overall. yale art & architecture building. yale's secret society buildings (some of which are called "tombs") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. a diversity of architectural styles is represented: donn barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); colonial style (constructed on an early 17th century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); victorian style (built in 1823). interior moulding is said to have belonged to manuscript society, king lui-wu with dan kniley responsible for landscaping and brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the kenneth m. murchison, 1912, designs inspired by elizabethan manor. current location, brick colonial; and campus safety in addition to the yale university police department, founded in 1894, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a violent crime rose in new haven, dampening yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts. between 1990 and 2006, new haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the new haven police and yale's campus became the safest among the ivy league and other peer schools. nonetheless, across the board, the city of new haven has retained the highest levels of crime of any ivy league city for more than a decade. in 2002-04, yale reported 14 violent crimes (homicide, aggravated assault, or sex offenses), when harvard reported 83 such incidents, princeton 24, and stanford 54. the incidence of nonviolent crime (burglary, arson, and motor vehicle theft) was also lower than most of its peer schools. in 2004, a national non-profit watchdog group called security on campus filed a complaint with the department of education, accusing yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults. academics admissions for the class of 2016, yale accepted 1,975 students out of a record 28,975 total applications, hitting a record-low acceptance of 6.8%. the university is one of only seven institutions of higher education in the world that is need blind and full-need to all of its applicants, including international students. through its program of need-based financial aid, yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants, and more than 50% of yale students receive financial assistance. most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average scholarship for the 2011-2012 school year was $35,400. more than 750 students in yale college are expected to have $0 parental contribution. half of all yale undergraduates are women, more than 30% are international students. fifty-five percent attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools. in addition, yale college admits a small group of nontraditional students each year, through the yale university library , which holds over 12 million volumes, is the second-largest university collection in the united states. the main library, sterling memorial library , contains about four million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. rare books are found in a number of yale collections. the harvey cushing/john hay whitney medical library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. the lewis walpole library contains the largest collection of 18th-century british literary works. the elizabethan club , technically a private organization, makes its elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through yale. yale's museum collections are also of international stature. the yale university art gallery is the country's first university-affiliated art museum. it contains more than 180,000 works, including old masters and important collections of modern art, in the swartout and kahn buildings. the latter, louis kahn 's first large-scale american work (1953), was renovated and reopened in december 2006. the yale center for british art , the largest collection of british art outside of the uk, grew from a gift of paul mellon and is housed in another kahn-designed building. the peabody museum of natural history in new haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. the yale university collection of musical instruments , affiliated with the yale school of music, is perhaps the least well-known of yale's collections, because its hours of opening are restricted. the museums also house the artifacts brought to the united states from peru by yale history professor u.s. news & world report' ranked yale third among national universities in 2012, as it has for each of the past fifteen years, in every case behind, in either order or tied, princeton and harvard. it was ranked fourth in the 2011 qs world university rankings parted ways to produce separate rankings.) yale had featured in the top five for each of the past four years. the same ranking also named yale as the fifth best university in the world for arts and humanities. shanghai jiao tong university's academic ranking of world universities , placed yale at 11 in 2010. arwu also ranked yale 25th in natural sciences and mathematics, 76-100th in engineering/technology and computer sciences, 9th in life and agriculture sciences, 21st in clinical medicine and pharmacy and 8th in social sciences worldwide. faculty, research, and intellectual traditions the college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the united states, and the largest such source within the ivy league. yale's english and comparative literature departments were part of the cleanth brooks were all yale faculty. later, the yale comparative literature department became a center of american jacques derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. several other yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called " paul de man who taught in the departments of comparative literature and french, geoffrey hartman (both taught in the departments of english and comparative literature), and harold bloom (english), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. historians david brion davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of david montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. yale's music school and department fostered the growth of music theory in the latter half of the 20th century. the david lewin were influential teachers and scholars. since summer 2010, yale has also been host to yale publishing course . campus life yale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the graduate and professional schools. undergraduates, or yale college students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, and socio-economic backgrounds. of the 2010-2011 freshman class, 10% are non-u.s. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools. yale is also an open campus for the gay community . its active lgbt community first received wide publicity in the late 1980s, when yale obtained a reputation as the "gay ivy," due largely to a 1987 wall street journal article written by julie v. iovine, an alumna and the spouse of a yale faculty member. during the same year, the university hosted a national conference on gay and lesbian studies and established the lesbian and gay studies center. the slogan "one in four, maybe more" was coined by the campus gay community. while the community in the 1980s and early 1990s was very activist, today most lgbt events have become part of the general campus social scene. for example, the annual lgbt co-op dance attracts straight as well as gay students. residential colleges, instituted in 1933 through a grant by yale graduate edward s. harkness , who admired the college systems at oxford and cambridge. each college has a dean, master, affiliated faculty, and resident fellows. each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, a commons room, meeting rooms/classrooms, and a dining hall; in addition some have chapels, libraries, squash courts, pool tables, short order dining counters, cafes, or darkrooms. each college at yale offers its own seminars, social events, and master's teas, and most of them are open to students from other residential colleges. however, yale remains a unitary university, while oxford and cambridge colleges are self-governed charitable institutions in their own right. all of yale's 2,000 undergraduate courses are open to members of any college. the dominant architecture of the residential colleges is neo-gothic , in line with the characteristic architecture of the university. several colleges have other period architecture, such as ezra stiles) have modernist concrete exteriors. students are assigned to a residential college in their freshman year. only two residential colleges ( timothy dwight) house freshmen. the majority of on-campus freshmen live on the " old campus ", an extensive quadrangle formed by older buildings. each residential college has its own dining hall, but students are permitted to eat in any residential college dining hall or the large dining facility called "commons." residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni. john c. calhoun, vice-president and influential member of congress of the united states. # john davenport, the founder of new haven. often called "d'port". # ezra stiles, a president of yale. generally called "stiles," despite an early-1990s crusade by then-master traugott lawler to preserve the use of the full name in everyday speech. its buildings were designed by silliman college , named for noted scientist and yale professor jonathan trumbull, first governor of connecticut. in 1998, yale launched a series of extensive renovations to the older residential buildings, which in many decades of existence had seen only routine maintenance and incremental improvements to plumbing, heating, and electrical and network wiring. many of these renovations have now been completed, and among other improvements, renovated colleges feature newly built basement facilities including snack bars called "butteries," game rooms, theaters, athletic facilities, fine arts studios, and music practice rooms. in june 2008, president levin announced that the yale corporation had authorized the construction of two new residential colleges, scheduled to open in 2013. the additional colleges, to be built in the northern part of the campus, will allow for expanded admission and a reduction of crowding in the existing residential colleges. designs have been released, and some public controversy has surfaced over yale's decision to demolish a number of historic buildings on the site, including a recently constructed library, in order to clear it for the $600 million new structures. student organizations the university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. the latter categories include the yale daily news, which was first published in 1878, the weekly the yale record, which was established in 1872 and is america's oldest college humor magazine. dwight hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in new haven. the yale college council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. the yale dramatic association and bulldog productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. in addition, the mace and chain. the two oldest existing honor societies are the aurelian (1910) and the torch honor society (1916). the elizabethan club , a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. membership is by invitation. members and their guests may enter the "lizzie's" premises for conversation and tea. the club owns first editions of a shakespeare folio, several shakespeare quartos, a first edition of milton's paradise lost , among other important literary texts. traditions yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their " bright college years ". ("bright college years," the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by die wacht am rhein.) yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of theodore dwight woolsey on old campus. actual students rarely do so. in the second half of the twentieth century bladderball , a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. in spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009 and 2011, but its future remains uncertain. ncaa division i level. like other members of the ivy league, yale does not offer athletic scholarships. yale bowl (the nation's first natural "bowl" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the payne whitney gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world. october 21, 2000 marked the dedication of yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. the is named to honor former olympic rower virginia gilder '79 and her father richard gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. yale also maintains the yale-harvard boat race. yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in america, and won yale corinthian yacht club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. ice hockey game in the united states. since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game. for kicks, between 1954 and 1982, residential college teams and student organizations played frisbie pie company tins. song notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as , alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, " fight song, "down the field." two other fight songs, "bulldog, bulldog" and "bingo eli yale", written by cole porter during his undergraduate days, are still sung at football games. another fight song sung at games is " refrain, "bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow." the school color, since 1894, is mascot in america, having been established in 1889. yale athletics are supported by the yale precision marching band . precision is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching. the band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. the year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. about half the sports are coeducational. at the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the tyng cup. richard gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion. ernesto zedillo; president of the federal republic of germany norman foster. yale in fiction and popular culture yale university, one of the oldest universities in the united states, is a cultural referent as an institution that produces some of the most elite members of society and its grounds, alumni, and students have been prominently portrayed in fiction and u.s. popular culture. for example, owen johnson 's novel, stover at yale , follows the college career of dink stover and frank merriwell , the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs. notes and references further reading bagg, lyman h. four years at yale , new haven, 1891. blum, john morton. a life with history (2004) 283pp, memoir of history professor and advisor to the president brown, chandos michael. benjamin silliman: a life in the young republic. yale old and new, 78 vols. personal scrapbook, 1942. biographical sketches of graduates of yale: yale college with annals of the college history, 6 vols. new york, 1885-1912. documentary history of yale university: under the original charter of the collegiate school of connecticut, 1701-1745.

T	'god particle' discovered, now the fun begins ? abilene reporter-news
C	keep up-to-date with 24/7 news, sports, entertainment, video and more from the ap wire ? somewhat to the regret of his fellow scientists, a physicist dubbed a subatomic particle that once existed only in theory as the "god particle," because without it the physical universe - stars, planets, us - wouldn't exist. the higgs boson - named for university of edinburgh professor peter higgs, one of the six physicists who postulated the particle's existence in 1964 - endows other basic particles, protons, neutrons, electrons, etc., with mass. scientists compare the process of an object acquiring size and weight to passing through molasses - the "higgs field." actually proving its existence proved considerably more difficult. the method chosen involved a 17-mile circular tunnel called the large hadron collider, operated by cern, the european center for nuclear research in geneva. the physicists would send particles rocketing around the collider at high speeds until the particles collided, and then the scientists would study the debris for traces of the higgs boson. to show how painstaking this was, joe incandela, the american physicist who led one of the two teams, said out of some 500 trillions collisions only several dozen produced "events" that could be studied. advanced physics doesn't come cheaply or easily. this discovery took two years, cost $110 billion and the work of 6,000 physicists. the scientists detected a faint glimmer of what might be the higgs boson last winter and began honing in on the fleeting, microscopic sightings of what may or may not have been the sought-after particle. cern's director, rolf heuer, was at first reluctant to go beyond saying they had found "a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." but wednesday in geneva, he told physicists gathered there and at webcam viewing stations around the world, "i think we have it." this was greeted with standing ovations, but perhaps no one welcomed his announcement more than dr. higgs, now 83, who was there in geneva for the celebration. where on earth did you get your cost figures? the lhc "only" cost about $10 billion to build. plane partners ecuadorean officer receives training at dyess upstairs downtown universal manufacturing building has long history keeping meals real texas cowboy reunion chuck wagon cook-off showcases authenticity rolling in dough abilene bakeries, doughnut shops busy abilene, big country and texas high school football at its best. one way to say thanks principal takes pie in the face for students' efforts a lot like christmas couple transforms yard for holidays homecoming victory wylie hangs on to lead, beats lubbock estacado crop duster, myth buster all stunts aside, flying is like driving ... but above ground bumpy or smooth? what condition is your street in? check our database share photos and videos with others around the big country.

C	sacrament- a teen was shot and killed by police in south sacramento ... washington (ap) - internet users scanning their twitter feeds or facebook ... the americans put up a strong showing atop the leaderboard heading into round 3 ... she's back...after missing out for the 2008 olympics in beijing, six-time ... by dan vergano, usa today physicists welcomed july fourth with intellectual fireworks, announcing "preliminary" results pointing to the discovery of the long-sought "god particle." formally known as the higgs boson, it was detected in experiments at the european organization for nuclear research (cern) lab near geneva. for the non-scientists who wonder what a higgs boson is, usa today distilled explanations from a number of physicists, including paul padley of rice university, part of one of the discovery teams: q: so what is a higgs boson? a: a tiny subatomic particle that apparently weighs about 130 times as much as an atom of hydrogen, the lightest gas. q: what does it do? a: simply put, the higgs particle interacts with other subatomic particles that are building blocks of atoms in a way that slows them down. it's the reason that matter in the universe has mass. mass gives the particles inertia, or resistance to being moved faster. q: what is a simple analogy that describes this effect? a: compare higgs bosons to groupies mobbing a celebrity. the other particles are the celebrities, desperately trying to move but slowed by autograph-seekers. higgs bosons don't have pens, but the attention they give to the other particles slows them, creating inertia. q: why did physicists think this likely had to exist? a: physicists look to particles to explain forces in the universe. in the physicists' theories, electromagnetic and nuclear forces don't need particles with mass to work. but the particles do have mass, so we need an explanation for why. in 1964, peter higgs of scotland's university of edinburgh and other physicists theorized the higgs boson was the culprit. q: how did they make this discovery? essentially, two teams collected data in separate experiments that smashed together millions of subatomic particles called protons to see what pieces emerged from the smash-ups. the particle reported on wednesday fell to pieces in ways predicted by higgs and other physicists. q: how sure are they that this is the higgs boson?

T	real think tank: cern celebrates as higgs signal reaches significance
C	cern celebrates as higgs signal reaches significance : a four-lepton decay, a possible sign of the higgs, seen by the atlas detector. cern today, in two seminars held at cern, the european center for physics announced evidence that the elusive higgs particle has finally been discovered. physics' standard model describes the fundamental particles that make up all matter, like quarks and electrons, as well as the particles that mediate their interactions through forces like electromagnetism and the weak force. back in the 1960s, theorists extended the model to incorporate what has become known as the higgs mechanism, which provides many of the particles with mass. one consequence of the standard model's version of the higgs is that there should be a force-carrying particle, called a boson, associated with the higgs field. for decades, physicists have been sifting through the output of colliders like the tevatron and lep, looking for an indication that the higgs was present in the spray of exotic particles they detected. the closest they got was a hint of a signal that didn't rise far enough above the background. now, in less than two years of operation, the large hadron collider's detectors have found clear evidence of a particle that looks a lot like the higgs. read 13 remaining paragraphs | comments related posts :

C	materials higgs boson may be an imposter, say particle physicists the news coming out of cern in recent weeks has been hard to miss. at first, there was a dripfeed of gossip which turned into a firehose of 'higgsteria'. finally, last wednesday, cern announced that it had found a new particle that is "consistent with the long-sought higgs boson". note the phrasing. cern has been careful not to claim that the new particle is the higgs, only that it could be. but if not the higgs, what else might it be? today, ian low at argonne national laboratory in illinois and a couple of buddies comb through the data in an attempt to throw some light on this question. their conclusion is that the data is consistent with at least two other particles that are not the standard higgs boson. particle identification is not always an easy task. physicists use a theory known as the standard model of particle physics to predict how particles should behave. in 1964, peter higgs and others used this theory to predict the existence of the higgs particle. they said it should be heavy and that it should exist only fleetingly before decaying into various other particles. in fact, its existence is so fleeting that the only way of spotting the higgs is to look for the signature of particles that it produces, such as pairs of photons or pairs of other heavy particles called z bosons. the trouble is that this signature is not unique, at least not given the amount of data that cern has so far collected. low and co say that given various assumptions about the data, there are several theoretical possibilities. one of these is that the data shows the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. but another equally likely option is that the data is evidence of a more exotic theory in which the higgs boson exists in several different forms. so the new particle might be one of these, examples of these are a generic higgs doublet or a triplet imposter. a final option is based on the idea that particles can exist in mixtures. so the new data does not show the higgs but a mixture of it and some other particle. low and co analyse the data and come to the following conclusion. "a generic higgs doublet and a triplet imposter give equally good ?ts to the measured event rates." in particular, they say that the predicted signatures of the higgs boson and the triplet imposter are both within one sigma of the measured value. and by one measure, the cern data even favours the triplet imposter. however, low and co are quick to add that the standard model prediction is a slightly better fit overall. the message here is that the data at this stage is far from conclusive and could support the existence of any of these three particles. so now there is much to do to clarify exactly what it is that cern has found. as low and co point out: "this is only the beginning of a challenging program of "higgs identi?cation". let the higgsteria continue. ref: have we observed the higgs (imposter)? : our list of the 10 most innovative technologies of 2012.

C	peter higgs joined three of the six theoreticians who first predicted the higgs at the conference. bbc physics - cern scientists reporting from the large hadron collider (lhc) have claimed the discovery of a new particle consistent with the higgs boson. the particle has been the subject of a 45-year hunt to explain how matter attains its mass. both of the higgs boson-hunting experiments at the lhc see a level of certainty in their data worthy of a "discovery". more work will be needed to be certain that what they see is a higgs, however. cern (european organization for nuclear research), home of the lhc in geneva, were met with loud applause and cheering. prof peter higgs, after whom the particle is named, wiped a tear from his eye as the teams finished their presentations in the cern auditorium. "i would like to add my congratulations to everyone involved in this achievement," he added later. "it's really an incredible thing that it's happened in my lifetime." prof stephen hawking joined in with an opinion on a topic often discussed in hushed tones. "this is an important result and should earn peter higgs the nobel prize," he told bbc news. "but it is a pity in a way because the great advances in physics have come from experiments that gave results we didn't expect." ? a confirmation that this is the higgs boson would be one of the biggest scientific discoveries of the century; the hunt for the higgs has been compared by some physicists to the apollo programme that reached the moon in the 1960s. scientists would then have to assess whether the particle they see behaves like the version of the higgs particle predicted by the standard model, the current best theory to explain how the universe works. more? this entry was posted on monday, july 9th, 2012 at 2:45 pm and is filed under the internet. you can follow any responses to this entry through the

T	scientists say 'god particle' may be an impostor [science]
C	last wednesday everyone went crazy when cern scientists announced proof of the existence of the higgs boson, which theoretically gives us mass and holds the universe together. now, other physicists say that cern may have found an impostor and not the popularly called god particle . after analyzing the data collected at cern's large hadron collider, scientists ian low, joseph lykken and gabe shaughnessy at the argonne national laboratory in illinois, claim that these observations may be explained by two other "impostor" particles, which may be masquerading as the fabled higgs boson: we show that current lhc data already strongly disfavor both the dilatonic and non-dilatonic singlet imposters. on the other hand, a generic higgs doublet and a triplet imposter give equally good fits to the measured event rates of the newly observed scalar resonance in their 20-page research paper-available through cornell university's arxiv (pdf) -low and his colleagues also add that, while the data may be explained by these two impostors, the "standard model higgs boson gives a slightly better overall fit." if they are right, however, the 30-year $9-billion quest to find the holy grail of physics, may have not ended yet. we have to wait indeed, this is nothing to be surprised about. when cern scientists claimed that they were 99.9999 percent sure that the measurements are the result of the existence of the higgs boson, they were cautious in their optimism, saying they needed to investigate more. joe incandela, professor of physics at the university of california, santa barbara, and head of the lhc's compact muon solenoid experiment, didn't want to point at the higgs boson just yet: the results are preliminary but the 5 sigma signal at around 125 gev we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks. the reason for his controlled optimism is the elusive nature of this particles. since we can only create them for a very limited time before they decay into other particles, it's very difficult to trace their signature. it's even more difficult when, looking at the the data so far collected by cern, the signature can be attributed to other particles. that's why low and his colleagues conclude that we need to wait and get more information, since the data at this stage cannot completely demonstrate the existence of the god particle or even these impostors.

T	higgs discovery fills in standard model of physics | realscience
C	the $10 billion particle accelerator doing high-energy physics experiments below the franco-swiss border just paid for itself with its first eureka moment. the european nuclear energy agency known as cern built the large hadron collider primarily to recreate the moments just after the big bang when subatomic particles flooded the universe decaying rapidly into atoms and elements. joe incandela expresses enthusiasm for his team's discovery of the higgs boson with a thumbs up just four years into the largest physics experiment in history scientists celebrated their first discovery. usually stoic scientists expressed forty years of feelings as the higgs boson moved from a theoretical subatomic particle that gives all matter its mass into an observed phenomenon. well, pretty much. like all things in science, there is no such thing as absolute and scientists never reach 100 percent certainty on anything. and so it goes with the higgs. but the 5,000 physicists involved in multiple experiments searching for the elusive particle are 99.99994 percent sure that they witnessed its presence, however fleeting. so it is with a high degree of certainty that scientists have claimed a discovery at cern. using the gold standard benchmark of particle physics scientists needed to be sure that what they were seeing was a new particle and not some noise from the instruments or other anomaly that would otherwise stand out. five sigma certainty while other high-energy physics labs could never get beyond a 4-sigma level of confidence in the data, research teams at cern made it to the coveted 5-sigma in announcing a new subatomic particle last week. while the difference between a 4-sigma and 5-sigma is very very small it makes a lot of difference to the scientists. with 5-sigma certainty there is a 1 in 3.5 million chance that cern has not discovered a new particle. even with that high degree of certainty, the researchers can't be entirely sure that the particle they have observed is the higgs boson. but it fits the profile and most agree that it really is the higgs. but they found something lurking in the theorized mass range of the higgs. the particle they discovered is somewhere between 125 and 126 billion electron volts (gev). the particle is 130 times heavier than the mass of a proton and requires a sophisticated particle accelerator that could smash protons at just about the speed of light in order to pop one of these heavy particles into existence. fermilab outside of chicago announced they had found evidence of the elusive higgs boson just days before the big announcement from cern. late last year scientists at both labs thought they caught a glimpse of the higgs' signature or footprint. but they needed more data. so after another six months of atom smashing and data crunching two cern experiments agree with the fermilab results. researchers at the famed tevatron accelerator can't claim a discovery but they can claim having seen a footprint and a shadow of the new, higgs-like particle. cosmic log creator alan boyle, "what we saw in december suggests that the real fireworks will be on the fourth of july." and they were. peter higgs embraces atlas team leader fabiola gianotti finding the god particle a little after midnight west coast time on july 4 scientists at cern shared a very technical presentation with the world, describing the latest findings from the cms and atlas detectors at the lhc. a room filled with physicists - many of whom have worked many sleepless nights preparing for this announcement - remained silent until project said, "this is what you get when you line up the zz and gamma gamma. they line up extremely well. and in the region of 125 gev they combine to give us a combined significance of 5 standard deviations." the audience went nuts. buried in the technical information is the discovery of a new particle and the scientific evidence that the observation is not a fluke or an error in the data. dr. incandela says, "this is a very very preliminary result but we think it's very strong. very solid. otherwise we wouldn't present it." higgs boson is last puzzle piece to complete standard model of physics rolf heuer closed the announcement by saying, "as a layman i would say we have it. would you agree?" the physcists in the tiered presentation room erupted in applause, signaling their agreement. though placing a decades old piece into the standard model of physics puzzle is very exciting and equal in scientific significance to the moment man first walked on the moon some physicists are hoping that this new particle turns out to be something other than the higgs boson. they are hoping this new particle will be a much bigger discovery, one that helps bring gravity into the standard model and one that helps unify albert einstein's theory of general relativity (solar system and galaxy scale) with quantum dynamics (nanoscale.) in many ways that would be much more significant. but for now, the confirmation work continues to determine the nature of the new particle, the first added to the standard model since 1978. and peter higgs, the 83-year-old scientist for whom the particle is named is just happy to be proved right in his lifetime. famed physicist stephen hawking bet against the higgs boson being found so he loses $100 and seems quite happy about it. stephen hawking smiles as he loses a $100 bet when higgs is boson found a smiling hawking says, "i had a bet with gordon kane of michigan university that the higgs particle wouldn't be found. it seems i have just lost $100." peter higgs, the father of the higgs boson was in geneva for the announcement of the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks, lives and behaves as he predicted. during the announcement the 83-year-old higgs teared up and said, "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place?i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and i shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." garret lisi has been waiting for the higgs to drop into the standard model. he has developed a geometrical model to explain the universe, called e8. in it he has placeholders for about 20 theorized and yet-to-be theorized particles, including the higgs boson. a. garrett lisi, a theoretical physicist and avid surfer left academia to live and surf in hawaii where he could work on physics and build his theory of everything. here are his thoughts about the higgs boson discovery. asteroid hunters want private telescope to spot dangerous space rocks jorge bauer i simply could not leave your web site before suggesting that i actually loved the us... guy i volunteer, send me to mars!!!!... micah kounthapanya i'll immediately take hold of your rss as i can not find your e-mail subscription hyp... marlon feirer i think other web-site proprietors should take this website as an model, very clean a... realscience is a general science news and information web site. it covers basic government and corporate research developments, breakthroughs, discoveries and scientific set backs. realscience has no sacred cows though it is unabashedly pro-science. it inspires the search for meaning in the world, exploration of our natural world and encourages building cross-disciplinary coalitions to solve big problems.

T	our opinion: now, fun begins with higgs boson particle ? times record news
C	somewhat to the regret of his fellow scientists, a physicist dubbed a subatomic particle that once existed only in theory as the "god particle," because without it the physical universe - stars, planets, us - wouldn't exist. the higgs boson - named for university of edinburgh professor peter higgs, one of the six physicists who postulated the particle's existence in 1964 - endows other basic particles, protons, neutrons, electrons, etc., with mass. scientists compare the process of an object acquiring size and weight to passing through molasses - the "higgs field." actually proving its existence proved considerably more difficult. the method chosen involved a 17-mile circular tunnel called the large hadron collider, operated by cern, the european center for nuclear research in geneva. the physicists would send particles rocketing around the collider at high speeds until the particles collided, and then the scientists would study the debris for traces of the higgs boson. to show how painstaking this was, joe incandela, the american physicist who led one of the two teams, said out of some 500 trillions collisions only several dozen produced "events" that could be studied. advanced physics doesn't come cheaply or easily. this discovery took two years, cost $110 billion and the work of 6,000 physicists. the scientists detected a faint glimmer of what might be the higgs boson last winter and began honing in on the fleeting, microscopic sightings of what may or may not have been the sought-after particle. cern's director, rolf heuer, was at first reluctant to go beyond saying they had found "a new particle that is consistent with a higgs boson." but wednesday in geneva, he told physicists gathered there and at webcam viewing stations around the world, "i think we have it." this was greeted with standing ovations, but perhaps no one welcomed his announcement more than dr. higgs, now 83, who was there in geneva for the celebration. feels like: 90? humidity: 57% precip: 40% new releases 'madea's witness protection' a banker caught up in his company's ponzi scheme is relocated. wichita county sheriff's office inmate roster: persons in the wichita county jail stay up to date on developing weather and news. sign up for trn e-mail alerts at this link.

T	love 4 bihar: bihar (muzaffarpur)-born physicist professor vivek sharma now leads the switzerland-and-france-based european organisation for nuclear research's compact muon solenoid experimentone of the first people to know about the existence of the higgs boson.
C	"i hate to call it the god particle," says bihar-born professor vivek sharma, one of the first people to know about the existence of the higgs boson, which scientists say is key to understanding the universe in an interview to george joseph "y ou and i exist because of this particle, though i hate to call it the god particle," said professor vivek sharma, one of the first people to know about the existence of the higgs boson, which scientists say is key to understanding the universe. sharma, professor of physics at the university of california, san diego, heads the switzerland-and-france-based european organisation for nuclear research's compact muon solenoid experiment -- one of the two large particle physics detectors built on the large hadron collider -- team that found the higgs boson. two major experiments, one headed by sharma, confirmed the existence of the sub-atomic particle. the discovery is being hailed as one of the most path breaking in modern times. the new particle is 125 times the mass of a proton. without this new particle, matter would not exist. when he was a child, sharma's mother, a sanskrit scholar, had told him that the 'song of creation' in the rig veda says the world was void and formless in the beginning and it was utter chaos. the words moved the young boy. "the song was a record of what the sages saw and thought thousands of years ago, "they were thinking of the origin of the world and from where the mass came to the world. it moved me and has driven me to pursue answers for the ancient question. by the technology of today i am now answering the curiosity posed by my ancestors thousands of years ago." two teams, the cms and atlas, with about 3,000 scientists, were looking for the higgs boson, the subatomic particle considered to be the cause for creating mass. both teams had almost reached at the same conclusion a few months ago. an official announcement was delayed for further studies. the teams have built the most complicated machines ever, like the large hadron collider, the particle accelerator where proton-photon collisions are used to search for the higgs boson. the multination project cost about $10 billion (rs 55,000 crore). "discovery of the higgs boson is a very important and a necessary clue to our understanding of the subatomic world and indeed why the universe exists," the particle is named after university of edinburgh physicist dr peter higgs, who was one of six physicists in the 1960s who suggested that a kind of cosmic molass pervading space is what gives particles their heft. higgs pointed out that these cosmic molasses would have their own quantum particle, so the branding rights went to him. the particle is also partly named after legendary indian scientist satyendra nath bose, who worked with albert einstein in the 1920s and made discoveries that led to the most coveted prize in particle physics. a large number of indian scientists, representing the saha institute of nuclear physics in kolkata , the tata institute of fundamental research in mumbai , the harishchandra research institute in allahabad and the institute of physics in bhubaneswar were also involved in the world's most ambitious experiment over the years. "india is like a historic father of the project," paolo giubellino, spokesperson of the geneva-based european centre for nuclear research (cern), told the press trust of india. how will the discovery impact life and science? "discoveries are made out of the curiosity," "we do not know how the discoveries will affect our life or knowledge. but the advanced technologies we have developed will percolate soon into public use. an example is the world wide web, which was created at cern for physicists to exchange data seamlessly... we gave this away to the world without cost, and it has led to a complete transformation of how we now communicate? apart from the trillions of dollars of transactions currently happening on the web." as soon as the higgs boson discovery was announced, sharma's eight-year-old daughter, a std ii student in san diego, e-mailed him a congratulatory message. sharma's wife works for motorola. rolf-dieter heuer, director general, cern, and others said that it was too soon to know for sure if the particle they found is an impostor as yet unknown to physics, perhaps the first of many particles yet to be discovered. that possibility is particularly exciting to physicists, as it could point the way to new, deeper ideas, the times noted. some physicists are still calling it a 'higgs-like' particle. sharma said that the particle "looks very much like a higgs boson." compact muon solenoid (cms ) experiment spokesperson joe incandela, a physicist at the university of california, santa barbara, said, "the results are preliminary but the five-sigma signal we're seeing is dramatic. this is indeed a new particle. we know it must be a boson and it's the heaviest boson ever found. the implications are very significant and it is precisely for this reason that we must be extremely diligent in all of our studies and cross-checks." in geneva, 1,000 people stood in line all night to get into an auditorium at cern to hear the announcement july 4. higgs entered the meeting to sustained ovation. the next step will be to determine the precise nature of the particle and its significance for our understanding of the universe. are its properties as expected for the long-sought higgs boson, the final missing ingredient? or is it something more exotic? all the matter that we can see, however, appears to be no more than about four per cent of the total. a more exotic version of the higgs particle could be a bridge to understanding the 96 per cent of the universe that remains obscure, according to cern. sharma said the "plan is to continue searching for new subatomic phenomena for the next decade and more." born in muzaffarpur, bihar, sharma obtained his master's in physics from the indian institute of technology, kanpur. he came to the united states in 1984 for higher studies. he also spent five years at cern in the early 1990s, where he discovered two new subatomic particles. he is a fellow of the american physical society and received the university of california, san diego ( ucsd ) academic senate award for distinguished teaching. other awards he has won include the cottrell scho lar award, research corporation, (1998 ); faculty for the 21st century, project kaleidoscope (1998); and national talent prize, ministry of science & education (india), 1979. asked if the new findings will change man's belief in religion/god, sharma, who planned to return to the us in a few days, said, "god is some thing very private and a matter of each individual's belief. i do experimental physics, not god."

T	explained: higgs boson 'god particle' | kgw.com portland
C	gallery see all 41 photos ? berlin -- scientists working at the world's biggest atom smasher near geneva have announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle that looks remarkably like the long-sought higgs boson. sometimes called the "god particle" because its existence is fundamental to the creation of the universe, the hunt for the higgs involved thousands of scientists from all over the world. what is the god particle anyway? school physics teaches that everything is made up of atoms, and inside atoms are electrons, protons and neutrons. they, in turn, are made of quarks and other subatomic particles. scientists have long puzzled over how these minute building blocks of the universe acquire mass. without mass, particles wouldn't hold together and there would be no matter. one theory proposed by british physicist peter higgs and teams in belgium and the united states in the 1960s is that a new particle must be creating a "sticky" field that acts as a drag on other particles. the atom-smashing experiments at cern, the european center for nuclear research, have now captured a glimpse of what appears to be just such a higgs-like particle. why is this important? the higgs is part of many theoretical equations underpinning scientists' understanding of how the world came into being. if it doesn't exist, then those theories would need to be fundamentally overhauled. the fact that it apparently does exist means scientists have been on the right track with their theories. but there's a twist: the measurements seem to diverge slightly from what would be expected under the so-called standard model of particle physics. this is exciting for scientists because it opens the possibility to potential new discoveries including a theory known as "super-symmetry" where particles don't just come in pairs - think matter and anti-matter - but quadruplets, all with slightly different characteristics. how much did it cost? cern's atom smasher, the large hadron collider, alone cost some $10 billion to build and run. this includes the salaries of thousands of scientists and support staff around the world who collaborated on the two experiments that independently pursued the higgs. were there any practical results from the search? not directly. but the massive scientific effort that led up to the discovery has paid off in other ways, one of which was the creation of the world wide web. cern scientists developed it to make it easier to exchange information among each other. the vast computing power needed to crunch all of the data produced by the atom smasher has also boosted the development of distributed - or cloud - computing, which is now making its way into mainstream services. advances in solar energy capture, medical imaging and proton therapy - used in the fight against cancer - have also resulted from the work of particle physicists at cern and elsewhere. what's next "this is just the beginning," says james gillies, a spokesman for cern. scientists will keep probing the new particle until they fully understand how it works. in doing so they hope to understand the 96 percent of the universe that remains hidden from view. this may result in the discovery of new particles and even hitherto unknown forces of nature. print print email email this article share tweet share share! x digg delicious myspace linkedin stumbleupon newsvine reddit previous article oregon's film & tv production thriving next article portland officer says man bit him during fight

C	reporter's notebook: higgs boson developments first-hand observations of higgs research at cern july 11, 2012 this summer i have had the opportunity to work with the mit physics faculty at cern, the european organization for nuclear research, near geneva, switzerland. cern is home to the large hadron collider (lhc), and i am here with a group of mit professors, postdocs, grad students, and undergrads working on the compact muon solenoid (cms). and yes, this is at the heart of the search for the higgs boson. i have witnessed most of the biggest behind-the-scenes events over the past month and will share them here. what is the higgs boson? it is an important part of the standard model, which is a theory in physics that explains three of the only four fundamental forces in nature - strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and electromagnetic force - that mediate all interactions of subatomic particles. the higgs boson is part of a theoretical mechanism proposed by several physicists in 1964 for the electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model, which is the phenomenon where the photon - the mediator of the electromagnetic force - is massless, while the w and z bosons - the mediators of the weak nuclear force responsible for radioactive decay of subatomic particles - are 80 and 91 times heavier than protons, respectively. the consequence of this prediction is a higgs field that permeates all space and interacts with some elementary particles, causing them to appear massive, while particles that don't interact with the field remain massless. the higgs boson decays so quickly, however, that the detectors cannot possibly observe it. the decay products can be observed, though - the mass at the center of the event can be reconstructed. many standard processes produce similar decay products, so there is a great deal of "background," but if the higgs boson exists, there should be an excess of events with its mass. when plotting histograms of events per mass, this excess shows up as a bump in data whose statistical significance can be measured. there are several types of decay processes ?- i.e. channels - that the higgs boson undergoes useful for this type of study, and different teams work on producing the extensive analyses for each decay. in december of 2011, cern announced a small signal excess at the mass of 125 giga-electronvolts (gev), but definitive conclusions couldn't be drawn until the signal significance reached the level of five sigma (five standard deviations above background). i arrived at cern in early june. following the december announcement, cern decided to intensify the data collection for the higgs search, conducting dedicated runs of the lhc between april and june. this step was taken in the hopes that the analyses would produce enough data to present significant results at the international conference of high energy physics (ichep) in july. to prevent any bias in designing the complex analysis algorithms, the numerical region of interest for the higgs mass was kept hidden ("blinded") in the new data. with the analysis architecture completed, it was time to "unblind" the region of interest, all just a week after i arrived. on a friday afternoon in june, i joined hundreds of cms physicists gathered in a large room at cern for the unblinding meeting. if the signal "bump" reappeared in the new data, it would almost certainly be due to the proposed explanation, while its absence would strongly suggest that the previous finding was a fluke and possibly exclude the higgs boson entirely. the information on a few powerpoint slides would essentially tell us if we were heading toward a confirmation or rejection of a major theory in particle physics. mit graduate student mingming yang g delivered the talk for the analysis of the decay channel of higgs to two photons. she announced that the 2011 and 2012 data revealed a four sigma signal excess at 125 gev for this single channel. this elicited a great deal of excitement from the audience. other analysis channels reported smaller excesses ?- most notably three sigma from the channel of higgs to two z particles to four leptons - but it was clear that the two-photon channel would drive the result, and a combination with other channels would produce an excess close to or exceeding five sigma. despite the excitement, the results had to stay within cms. the next few weeks were a flurry of activity. these results had to be presented and approved by publication committees. there were important meetings almost every day, and the schedule became even tighter when cern announced that there would be a seminar with an update on the higgs search just one day before ichep. i was impressed how intensely all the physicists scrutinized the results, even discussing details of single plots or histograms for extended periods of time. the analyses then had to be "topped up" with the new data collected since the unblinding, and these results also had to be approved. the combination of the results from each channel was presented, producing a 4.7 sigma excess before the final data was added. the scale and hype of the announcement seminar were on a different level entirely. i began waiting outside the door of the auditorium at 2 a.m. for the 9 a.m. meeting and there were already fifty people in front of me. by 7:30 a.m., over one thousand people, ranging from college kids to research scientists, were waiting outside, and most did not get a seat. the media was out in full force, and cern had invited the original theorists of the mechanism, including peter higgs, to attend. finally, in a fashion more dramatic than one would expect from a physics presentation, joe incandela, the cms spokesperson, announced that cms' analyses produced an overall significance of 4.9 sigma, or 5.0 if only considering the most sensitive channels. the atlas (a toroidal lhc apparatus) collaboration at the lhc, which worked completely independently from cms, also announced near identical results, with a signal also present at 125 gev. the excitement following the announcement was extensive and somewhat amusing. i briefly met peter higgs, and watched normally laid-back scientists get swarmed by the media. in the end, i was simply grateful to have witnessed some of the biggest events leading up to an important event in the history of physics. perhaps i am a bit spoiled to only see it at the most exciting time, but this experience has given me more respect for the scientific method as implemented in large inquiries, even when bureaucracy and media leaks get in the way.

T	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle | science | guardian.co.uk
C	higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle scientists at the cern research centre in switzerland reveal they have found a new subatomic particle that could be the higgs boson link to this video there comes a time in a scientist's life when the weight of evidence can no longer be ignored. that moment came today for physicists at announced overwhelming evidence for the obscure but profoundly important higgs boson, the particle that sparked the greatest hunt in modern science. in presentations given to a packed auditorium at the laboratory on wednesday morning, and webcast around the world, the leaders of two research teams, who worked independently of each other, said they had spotted a new particle amid the microscopic flashes of primordial fire created inside the world's most powerful atom smasher. cern stopped short of claiming official discovery of the higgs boson, even as many physicists conceded the evidence was now so compelling they had surely found the missing particle. formal confirmation of the discovery is expected within months, though it could take several years for scientists to work out whether they have found the simplest kind of higgs particle that theories predict, or part of a more complex picture: for example, one of a larger family of higgs bosons. the discovery of more than one kind of higgs particle would open the door to an entirely new realm of physics. "is it a higgs boson or not? well, it has been found using techniques tuned for the standard model higgs. a different object might have stepped in, but it is quite unlikely in my humble opinion," said tommaso dorigo , a scientist on the cms experimental team at cern. the standard model higgs boson is the most simple proposed version of particle. the queue for the auditorium left some physicists struggling for a seat to hear the announcement. those inside broke into applause when peter higgs, the 83-year-old father of the particle, entered the room. "cern should really build a larger auditorium. the present one is nice and cosy, but it is embarrassing and sad to see many distinguished colleagues queueing up at five in the morning knowing that they have a slim chance to get a seat, after working for 20 years on finding the higgs boson," said dorigo. scientists and engineers at the lab, many exhausted from working round the clock in recent weeks, clapped and whistled as joe incandela and fabiola gianotti, the respective heads of the large hadron collider detector teams called cms and atlas, presented their results for the first time. both teams saw the particle, which has a mass of around 125 to 126 gev, about 130 times the mass of a proton. "it's hard not to get excited by these results," said cern research director, sergio bertolucci. the lab's director general, rolf dieter heuer, said: "we have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature." he later added: "as a layman i would now say i think we have it" - meaning the higgs. they have worked hard and long for this day. the particle, which is unlike any other known to exist, was proposed 48 years ago, when physicists worked on the laws of nature with pen and paper instead of the sleek, high-end laptops they carry around today. the hunt has spanned decades and occupied thousands of researchers from tens of countries. for some, this has been their life's work. there is never a bad time for good news, but cern will be relieved to have made the breakthrough before the machine shuts down for almost two years at the end of 2012, when engineers move in to carry out work for the accelerator to run at its full design energy. the discovery of the higgs particle ranks as one of the most important scientific advances of the past 100 years. it proves there is an invisible energy field that pervades the vacuum of the known universe. this field is thought to give mass to the smallest building blocks of matter, the quarks and electrons that make up atoms. without the field, or something like it, there would be no planets, stars, or life as we know it. while scientists work to understand the new particle, the discovery raises a quandary for the nobel committee that must now decide who deserves credit for the work. traditionally, nobel prizes go to no more than three people, but six physicists published papers on the theory in 1964, and others laid important groundwork beforehand or developed the theory later. peter higgs at edinburgh university was the first to point out in 1964 that a new particle, the eponymous boson, was a by-product of the mass-giving field. that was a crucial step, because it gave scientists a smoking gun to hunt for in their experiments. one of the original gang of six, robert brout at the free university in brussels, died last year. the others are francois englert from belgium, tom kibble from the uk, and dick hagen and gerry guralnik in the us. peter higgs said: "i am astounded at the amazing speed with which these results have emerged. they are a testament to the expertise of the researchers and the elaborate technologies in place. "i never expected this to happen in my lifetime and shall be asking my family to put some champagne in the fridge." according to the theory, all of the particles in the newborn universe were massless and hurtled around at the speed of light. but one trillionth of a second after the big bang, the higgs field switched on, turning the vacuum of space into a kind of cosmic glue. some particles feel the higgs field more than others. the quarks that make up atomic nuclei feel a lot of drag from the field, and become heavy for subatomic particles. others, such as electrons, feel less drag and gain much less weight. particles of light, called photons, feel no drag at all, and so remain massless and keep moving at the speed of light. to find the higgs particle, physicists at cern sifted through the subatomic debris of more than 1,000 trillion proton collisions inside the large hadron collider. occasionally, these collisions might create a higgs boson, which immediately disintegrates into more familiar particles. to spot the boson, the scientists have to look for unusual excesses of the particles it decays into, which appear as bumps in their data. particle physicists use a "sigma" scale to rank the certainty of their results which ranges from one to five. one and two sigma results come and go and are often no more than statistical fluctuations in the data. a three sigma result counts as an official "observation", but five sigma is usually needed to claim a discovery, amounting to less than a one in a million chance that it is wrong. evidence for the higgs boson has risen sharply in the past seven months. in december, the atlas and cms teams at cern reported what appeared to be hints of a higgs particle weighing about 125gigaelectronvolts (gev), roughly 130 times heavier than a proton. on wednesday, that evidence became overwhelming. the atlas team reported a particle at 126.5gev with a confidence of five sigma, while the cms team found a particle with a mass of 125.3 gev with a 4.9 sigma confidence. at the end of the announcement, the room erupted into a standing ovation of whoops, cheers and whistles. peter higgs, reached for a tissue and wiped a tear from his eye. sean carroll, a physicist at california institute of technology, said there was the slightest sign of something unusual in the results. "it's clear that the lhc has discovered a new particle. it's very much like the standard model higgs boson - but there are just enough differences to be interesting. if the differences are real, they very possibly come from new particles interacting with the higgs. the fun has just begun!" ben allanach, a physicist at cambridge university, said: "rolf was right though when he said 'i think we have it'." jeff forshaw, a physicist at manchester university, said: "this is sensational news and quite brilliant science. without doubt, cern has delivered us a new particle that looks every bit like the long-sought-after higgs boson, which is absolutely central to our understanding of how the universe works at its most elemental level. i have waited over 20 years for this moment and am thrilled by the news. the excitement will continue now, as we all try to figure out just how this thing behaves." john ellis, who has worked at cern since the 1970s, said the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics. "there is no doubt that something very much like the higgs boson has been discovered. the strengths of the signals observed independently by cms and atlas are completely convincing, and they are supported by data from the tevatron experiments cdf and d0. "now the emphasis will shift to verifying the properties of the particle that has been discovered: does it have spin zero? does it couple to other particles proportional to their masses? "the discovery will open up a new era in particle physics, as we look for deviations from the properties expected in the standard model, and for other physics beyond the standard model that might be connected, such as the nature of dark matter." "we're not certain, but i'd be willing to bet the house this turns out to be some sort of higgs particle," said joe incandela, spokesperson for the cms collaboration. higgs boson: it's unofficial! cern scientists discover missing particle prof higgs: nice to be right about boson physicist who gave his name to the higgs boson that scientists believe they have found tells of vindication after 50 years higgs boson: a cause for celebration. but will it be our last great discovery? themis bowcock: the higgs boson discovery is another giant leap for humankind follow all the top science stories of the day on twitter @huffingtonpost rare amur tiger cubs born at columbus zoo (video) no sound, but your "oooos" & "aaaaws" will suffice which reminds me. i interviewed nick clegg about science when i had a radio show at imperial college around 1997 election. i have the tape. mid-phd i did a placement with the bbc world service science dept at quantum universe by brian cox ?7.19 spark of life by frances ashcroft ?16.00

T	higgs boson may be an imposter, say particle physicists - technology review
C	materials higgs boson may be an imposter, say particle physicists the news coming out of cern in recent weeks has been hard to miss. at first, there was a dripfeed of gossip which turned into a firehose of 'higgsteria'. finally, last wednesday, cern announced that it had found a new particle that is "consistent with the long-sought higgs boson". note the phrasing. cern has been careful not to claim that the new particle is the higgs, only that it could be. but if not the higgs, what else might it be? today, ian low at argonne national laboratory in illinois and a couple of buddies comb through the data in an attempt to throw some light on this question. their conclusion is that the data is consistent with at least two other particles that are not the standard higgs boson. particle identification is not always an easy task. physicists use a theory known as the standard model of particle physics to predict how particles should behave. in 1964, peter higgs and others used this theory to predict the existence of the higgs particle. they said it should be heavy and that it should exist only fleetingly before decaying into various other particles. in fact, its existence is so fleeting that the only way of spotting the higgs is to look for the signature of particles that it produces, such as pairs of photons or pairs of other heavy particles called z bosons. the trouble is that this signature is not unique, at least not given the amount of data that cern has so far collected. low and co say that given various assumptions about the data, there are several theoretical possibilities. one of these is that the data shows the higgs boson as predicted by the standard model. but another equally likely option is that the data is evidence of a more exotic theory in which the higgs boson exists in several different forms. so the new particle might be one of these, examples of these are a generic higgs doublet or a triplet imposter. a final option is based on the idea that particles can exist in mixtures. so the new data does not show the higgs but a mixture of it and some other particle. low and co analyse the data and come to the following conclusion. "a generic higgs doublet and a triplet imposter give equally good ?ts to the measured event rates." in particular, they say that the predicted signatures of the higgs boson and the triplet imposter are both within one sigma of the measured value. and by one measure, the cern data even favours the triplet imposter. however, low and co are quick to add that the standard model prediction is a slightly better fit overall. the message here is that the data at this stage is far from conclusive and could support the existence of any of these three particles. so now there is much to do to clarify exactly what it is that cern has found. as low and co point out: "this is only the beginning of a challenging program of "higgs identi?cation". let the higgsteria continue. ref: have we observed the higgs (imposter)? : our list of the 10 most innovative technologies of 2012.
